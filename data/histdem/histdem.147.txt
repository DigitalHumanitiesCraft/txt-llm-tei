Jasenica + Kruševac 1863: 9,746 persons, 1,854 

The 1863 population census of Serbia is from the Serbian State Archives (Arhiv Srbije) in Belgrade. This data was provided after an official request was made by Prof. Joel M. Halpern to the archive and provided to him directly by archive personnel. No restrictions were made. In the 1960s digitization was carried out under grants made to Joel M. Halpern at the University of Massachusetts, Department of Anthropology, with funding from the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health), and research grants from the University of Massachusetts. Subsequent work was done during the 1990s and 2000s at the University of Graz, Austria, beginning in 1993 with funding from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF). Detailed information is available in the Joel Martin Halpern collection from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst/Special collections &amp; University archives.

note:The city of Kruševac contains 102 servants who live alone and have no property at all. They were enumerated as separate units in the census, because they had an income, but they were obviously not forming independent households. Therefore they are coded as servants and not household heads and their households as incomplete households. The census does not have information about the place where they served. 45 servants have either co-residing relatives or property of their own, therefore they are treated as independent households.
