They were enumerated as separate units in the census, because they had an income, but they were obviously not forming independent households. Therefore they are coded as servants and not household heads and their households as incomplete households. The census does not have information about the place where they served. 45 servants have either co-residing relatives or property of their own, therefore they are treated as independent households."
