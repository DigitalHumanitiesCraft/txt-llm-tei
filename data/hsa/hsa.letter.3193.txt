Dear Dr Schuchardt,
I await your answer about baita, and pitilin in Slovenian which I claim as Iberian words. I have begun the N. T. in Esthonian, Lettish & Slovenian. At the last meeting of De Charenceys society there was much talk on Basque, and I announced your new work. I go to another tomorrow with some polyglot friends of divers nationalities. His address is 25 Rue Barbet de Jouy. I told Larrieu to write to you about the Souletin Imitation which I consider a most important book. I have found in it a case of the demonstrative used exactly like an article. I have finished Carbonis sermons. In vol: 1. p. 292 
fuliaiant is used to mean as Spanos Dictionary gives it to mean throw, gettare but on p. 360. si fuliant looks as if ought to mean “rot”, “become putrid” as if it came from Gothic fuls. Does falare = descendere come from fall# “tomber”? What do biaita, an epithet of a face, and ghespargi# mean? Eine = morçeau in Esthonian reminds me of Basqueaiñu the pittance of a shepherd – the Esthonians use it for le goũter or small nuncheon. Would the use of gef to make the conditional of both active and intransitive verbs in Luxembourg be comparable to old English gif the imperative of to give whence modern “if” – it means of course suppose that, grant that, concede that etc: May BasqueZiriña = Diarrea explain Spanishsírle & Síria = Sheep-dung? I find that IBE in Aino means to feed (sheep) it is used in the end of the Gospel of St John when Christ says to St. Peter Pasce oves meos - can this explain IBERUS – Armenianoord pronounced oort means canal, rigole. a year is a canal in which the river of time runs rapidly – does this explain Basqueurte the flood, the year? Do you write to De Charencey Did you get the separatabdruck of the proverbs?
