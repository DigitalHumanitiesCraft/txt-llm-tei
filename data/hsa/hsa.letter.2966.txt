Dear Sir,
I am sorry to say I have never heard of the book to which Dr.. Burnell referred (note 1) and do not know where it is to be found. If I hear anything about it I shall inform you.
Yours faithfully,
R. Caldwell, Bp.. 

_____________________________________________1 This probably refers to the book Gup. Sketches of Anglo-Indian life and character, by Florence Marryat, published in 1868 in London. This book is mentioned in the last of Arthur Burnell’s letters to Schuchardt (
Nr. 1468) in the following terms: “A book called “Gup“ (by Florence Marryat, about 1865) will give you much information about the half-casts etc.“ (transcribed in:
