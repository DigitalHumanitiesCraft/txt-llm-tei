 best thanks for letter received last night. I heard from Priebsch yesterday: he is at 24 Upper Woburn Place, London. W.C. I will ask about the expressions you mention. I have thought that a hypothetic deritze now deitze from deia, a call, l’appel, might account for deritzat etc: you know how r between two vowels disappears in Basque especially in Souletin. 
Larrieu tells me that an old Souletin he used to know born last century always sounded such rs. It is a modern aberration. I leave 
Paris tonight – address from Saturday night Poste Restante, Bayonne. Azkue is full of morgue because people won't substitute the A]s[zkuence for the Bascuence of Biscaya.
Yours in great haste
E. S. Dodgson.
