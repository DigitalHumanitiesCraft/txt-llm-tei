Hôtel Condal, 23 Boqueria 23, Barcelona. 28 November 1894.
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I hope you are not offended with me again. (note 1)
the above will be I believe my address during the remainder of this year. When are you going to reply to my as yet unanswered questions? Do you consider them too gooselike? When is your Academy going to thank me for the copy of my Capanaga which I sent to it by you? 
Vinson says he sent me a proof of my article on Capanaga in the April number of La Revue de Linguistique 1894. I never had it, and the result was fatal as Vinson put in what he calls “my only corrections”. He cannot write English. He has not yet sent me a proof of the corrigenda which he said should appear in October, though I told him I had some important additions to make. I have found in the University Library here the 4 volumes of La Revista de Ciencias Historicas containing a most important work by a Bilbao priest of 1653 Rafael Micoleta, a contemporary of Capanaga. His Basque is very much like that of Capanaga, and I only wish I had known of it sooner. Vinson says nothing about him or Colmenar. I think of reprinting, with corrections, the dialogues which are very interesting. With notes, they would form about 12 pages of the same size as my Capanaga. I find that Vinson does mention casually the Basque works of Nicolas Antonio, Araquiztain, Hervas, and Bullet, but he puts none of them in their proper place in the chronological catalogue, nor does he mention these writers in his list of authors – Please send your separat-abdruck (note 2) in reply to Vinson and also your letter to or (note 3) about 
Leskien.
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson.
