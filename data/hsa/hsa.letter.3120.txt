Dear Sir,
within the next ten days an answer would find me I think at à la lista, San Sebastian, after that it would at least be forwarded from Poste Restante, S
t. Jean de Luz. I have been for a tour through several villages in La Soule where I have never been before. I notice how all rs between vowels disappear in that language. Nearly all the Souletins speak Béarnais, and so that idiom tends to pervert their Basque even more than the French. I think you would find Canon Inchauspe, at Abense de Haut, près Tardets, willing to explain phenomena in Souletin and other dialects of Euskarian, if you write to him in Labourdin, latin, or French. Also Mr. Simon Gurruchaga, instituteur en retraite, Maison Communale, Mendibe, par S
t. Jean Pied de Port, would be of use to you for the semasiology and grammar of the popular Souletin and Bas Navarrais. I was present throughout the fêtes at St Jean de Luz. The rain spoilt the Pastoral partly, and made the seats wet when they coud begin it again, and the whole of the last day was drenching; yet they carried out the masquerade in the afternoon 
quandmême, “Ezset eginic”. Do you think pachara in Guipuzcoan, meaning apparently “appearance” of a house, comes from Spanish fachada? I shall make a short tour in Guipuzcoan before going to Pau for the Congress 15 – 22 Septembre when all good Bascophiles should be present. Don A. Arzac is very well, gay, and aimiable. Don G. O. madder than ever, almost useless -
