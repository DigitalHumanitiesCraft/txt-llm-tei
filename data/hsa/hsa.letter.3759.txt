address Post Office, Cork, Ireland, 2 October, 1897.
Dear Dr H. Schuchardt, 
I was glad to get your letter of the 28th of September from Gotha today, but equally sorry to find it so full of bad news about the health of your mother, your friend G. Meyer, whose Albanian Dictionary I have, and yourself. I am also grieved to hear that Leiçarraga is being reprinted without correction! A. Farinelli is to be married to Miss Natter at Gmunden tomorrow. The Clarendon Press politely declines to publish my work on Leiçarragas verb. I have failed elsewhere also to obtain the realisation of my hopes.
E. S. Dodgson. 

 (note 1) I am staying at Waterville on the coast of Kerry.
