Dear Sir
I have not heard from you for several years, and do not know if you have published any more works on Creole dialects, especially Ceylon Portuguese. The latest I have is No. IX, Kreolische Studien. I shall be glad to receive any more you have written. I send you a paper with some Ceylon Portuguese sentences, which may interest you. I have left Ceylon, on account of my health.
Yours truly

Donald Ferguson
