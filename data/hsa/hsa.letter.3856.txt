Hamburg v.d. Höhe
Verehrter Herr Professor,
I have really no patience with you- you dear man! Yes the Hobson-Jobson book (note 1) is rather expensive but it is large and contains a great deal. And if I were to write out a really full account of all there is in it, or a very small one indeed – you on the other hand in the same time could knock off a few words of creole Slang and a few remarks for my Dicty which would buy the Burnell & Yule (note 2) twice over. However I would write or give the Auskunft right willingly if I had the book by me but I have not as I  left it in London with G. May (note 3) my publisher to whom it belongs. However I can tell you that it is quite a mine of valuable and curious learning as to all Indian familiar subjects and objects, works and things. It is a book which is really indispensable to you, as you will say when you come to examine it. There is a great number of Oriental words coming into common use, in all European languages, which few, even scholars, fully understand. You could make the Yule Burnell the basis for a capital book on familiar Oriental terms. There is really too much in it, and you could  cut down the Hindu and extend the rest to embrace all the Oriental words which are commonly found in German, French and English books. I dare say that any publisher would engage it from you.
Are you up on Jénisch (note 4)the common language used on the roads? I had a lesson in it the day before yesterday from a basket maker who was travelling with a van. He knew a great deal of Romany, especially his daughter and this made me at home with them. Jénisch seems to be the old Rothwälsch or 
Kauderwälsch but more mixed with Gypsy and Hollandish Dieven-taal. Of course there is a great deal of Hebrew in it. They  make a secret of knowing it. In it Romanis becomes Ma’hnis.
I find an interesting subject of research in the amulets or charms worn by these people especially the gypsies.
I have great hopes that I shall be in Gratz this Autumn.
It was a great disappointment, my not getting something from you for the dicty –no matter what- as Maj. Powell (note 5) of the Ethnographical Bureau at Washington had specially recommended me- apart from my own independent determination. “Peu pour vous et beaucoup pour nous.”
Truly your friend
Charles G. Leland
