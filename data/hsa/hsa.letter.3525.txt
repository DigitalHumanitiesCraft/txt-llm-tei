Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I still await your answer to many of my questions on my linguistic observations. I think the next number of La Revue de Linguistique will contain something that will interest you, though written by me whom you despise so much and understand so little. I have not heard when number 16 of Euskara is to appear. Linschmann has manuscripts of mine enough to fill the whole of it I think. I do not often agree with Webster, but he is right in saying the Basque studies are a 
thankless task. The 2nd edition of Haraneders Gudu Izpirituala, which Vinson calls a réimpression pure et simple, is in my opinion an ignorant, fraudulent adulteration, painful to compare with the beautiful original, which ought to be reprinted. I went last week for a little over 48 hours to Figueras & the region of Cap de Creus. I noticed how often there they say petits, petitos, especially in calling their goats – they say altro for altre, senza for without, murilho for muzzle (of a dog). I bought lately at Arles-sur-Tech a Catalan book printed at Olot in 1714, in which though generally one finds 
vostre, nostre these words occur here and there as vostron and nostron. This may be a survival from old Catalan. It reminds one of the forms mon, ton, son which are used when preceding their substantive while men, ten, sen are used after the substantive. In the dept. de l’Aude they say gacho! for regardez. Is it related to English watch? Adresse Poste Restante Toulouse. I shall (note 1) call there on Mr Gèze who once wrote to me. 
 (note 2) I find Paulus Merula (cosmographia) of 1605 in the Public Library here at (note 3) Carcassonne, but no other book of Bascological interest.
Yours truly 
E. S. Dodgson.
4 April 1895.
