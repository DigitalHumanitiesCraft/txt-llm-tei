Kertch, January 28.1896
Dear Professor Schuchardt,
Your post-card and the copy of the review of my sister’s book (note 1) have reached me. Many thanks! We are well aware of the importance of publishing a Collection of the Folk tales of Svanethi, and have much material gathered for the purpose.
At present we are preparing for the press a translation of the Life of Saint Nino, compared with all the best mscr. (note 2) The text is not easy: many passages are obscure and evidently very corrupt. The Georgians must do a great deal of preliminary work before their older literature can be profitably read by foreign students.
We are expecting every day to receive some copies of the translation of The Hermit, (note 3) and I  shall send you a copy.
Possibly some of my letters to you have miscarried. The postal department of this Country leaves much to be desired – e. g. a few boxes posted to me in Rome on the 14th of November did not reach me till the 26
th of January!
We are now in a state of almost complete isolation: the port has been frozen up for a month, and our only intercourse with the World is along the Theodosia road, which is so bad that it sometimes takes longer for a letter to go from Kertch to Theodosia than from Theodosia to London. The ice is not likely to break up before the middle of March.
With best wishes,

Believe me,

Sincerely yours

Oliver Wardrop
