Monsieur le Secrétaire
de l’Académie Impériale des Sciences,
Vienna,
Austria.
Hotel Metropole, Cork, Ireland. November 16, 1897. 
Dear Sir, 
I congratulate the Imperial Academy of Sciences on having so nobly resolved to reprint the Basque New Testament of Leiçarraga. When Dr H. Schuchardt was elected one of your members I wrote to him, about four years ago I think, and congratulated him. At the same time I pressed him to try to persuade your learned Society to reprint that important book. I have written to thank him for his labours in the matter. But I must warn you that a grave mistake will be made if you allow him to carry out his intention of reproducing all the misprints of the original edition. These are very numerous, as I coud demonstrate to you or to him. Reverence for Leiçarraga, for the Basque language, for the New Testament, for Scientific truth & for posterity compels me to implore your honoured Academy not to permit this disastrous plan.
I am, Sir, yours truly
Edward S. Dodgson.
