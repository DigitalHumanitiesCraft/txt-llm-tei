Baltimore, 1/16, 1887.
My dear Sir,
Your kind favor of 12 Sept. was duly received and made me regret more than ever my misfortune in not being able to see you this last summer. I have so many things to talk over with you about the speechmixture [sic] problem in America that I must surely try to see you during the coming summer. You possibly have made no plans for the vacation? If so, will you kindly tell me in your next where you intend to be, so that I may make my arrengements accordingly, before leaving home. There is no other place, probably, so favorable for the study of mixture in leading languages as our country and there is so much connected with the study on the spot that I should like to consult you about, I feel I must get at you some way. Your Slawo-D and Slawo-It., (note 1) I find to be the only work in which I can  at the present gather any help for my Canadian work. Owing to many disturbing circunstances, I have not been able to move on to the scientific part of this question so early as I had hoped in the beginning. It seemed to me necessary, first of all, to give some idea of the pecular [sic], external influences which, in this country, made directly toward a uniformity of speech – the social, political and religious phases of this early settlement. Now I am ready for the speech proper and I assure you, I do not find it any easy undertaking. The further I work into it, the greater admiration I have for your work in this line. A copy of the Proceedings of the Mod. Lang. Ass. (note 2) was sent you, according to my note at the time, but may have gone down on one of our unfortunate transatlantic ships that foundered about this time. I now send you the 
Transactions, and hope I shall be fortunate with them. They contain Mr. Fortier’s full article on the Negro-french. (note 3) It is only a sketch, but the material is there. Prof. F. promises to work out in time a regular grammar on the subject.
We have just had a most interesting Convention in Baltimore of the Mod. Lang. Ass. (note 4) I shall send you the Proceedings as soon as they are published.
Yours very truly,
A.M.Elliott
