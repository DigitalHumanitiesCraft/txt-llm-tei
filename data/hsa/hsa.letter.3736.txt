28 June 1896. 
Dear Dr Schuchardt 
continuing my other card I have to tell you that I have omitted in my list of verbs in Van Eys proverbs this p. 40 ezlemayo. I found that out about 2 weeks ago. Can you obtain from Van Eys or his publisher a list of the people or libraries owning copies of his edition, so that I may sent my yellow appendix to them. It cost me 25 francs, paid to the printer on the first of May, and I would rather give it away than let it be wasted. Please inform others of the omission of ezlemayo. I have not only, alas!, something to add to the corrigenda of my inscriptions, but, to console me for that, a considerable supplement already, including the inscriptions on two bells cast this month in the monastery, once Benedictine now Franciscan, of Nájera, the Westminster of Navarra. Among the 8 friars 6 are Spanish Basques, a small Euskarian colony where no doubt Basque was spoken in the time of Pompey. At Tricio close by I got 3 Iberian coins with inscriptions. Fita thinks one of them may be new to science. I have not yet had Huebners opinion. Tricio may well have been once the 
guard-town of the surrounding valley. It once was Samiona that is 
zain-ona. Think of Santoña on the Biscayan coast, and places called La Guardia in this peninsular. Many Roman inscriptions & coins have been found there. There are a good many Basques in this city. One sees not a few persons crippled in the awful explosion of Nov: 3, 1893.
