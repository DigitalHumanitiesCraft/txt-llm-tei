Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
your letter came today with a card from Thomas who says that Vinson contributes to his edition of D’Urte a vocabulary of the verbal forms. Quaritch tells me you have bought some of the Princes books, and that the sale of the library itself is put off owing to feuds in the family! I dont think there is any difference between 
Diraustazu and Dirauztazu. In old Basque z and s appear to have had very often, but not always, the same value, at least before t. Oihenart in his notitia says that z = tz, which is evident from Capanaga and other texts. Mr Constantine Bordachar of St Jean le Vieux told me that Çamariac penxaraciten dirauztaçu (note 1) must mean ”il m’a fait soigner les chevaux” and that the verb as now used would be 
dirauztazie. Next week my Capanaga will both be paid for, at a great sacrifice out of my own pocket, and printed off finally. You shall have 2 copies – one for the Library of your Imperal Academy if it has one. I had a letter from Leite de Vasconcellos (Bib: Nac: Lisboa) today. He thinks as I suggested in 1881 that bãi (with a fermée as he says) is a manner of pronouncing bem from latin bene. I proposed long ago that bai even in Basque might come from bene. I think I have found lots more Basque words in Portuguese nomenclature and language. But you confess your narrowness. I have thought of latin peccare coming from Basque be or pe. Is inguru from Greek ἐν γύρῳ? I have received but not from the author, Arzacs booklet maricho (Donostian 1893): Arzac did not publish my letter saying that basque zitzarra (note 2) is from latin Hebrew sicera as 7 times in St Jeromes Bible, once in S. Luke. ch:1.V.15.
