Dear Professor Schuchardt,
I hope that you will let me have some sign of your existence and of your friendship (for I believe this exists in spite of your occasional rudeness) & also an opinion on the little work which I have dedicated to you. Only 25 copies of it were granted to me. The heat here has been very great for the last few days. It is almost settled that I am to go to a college at Vizeu in Portugal to begin in September to teach English, French, and German. For many reason I have wished and I believe that you will be able to share my wish to be settled in the Basque region so that I may while earning money and being usefully occupied continue the study of Basque which inspires me more and more deeply with a monomaniacal passion. It appears from Leiçarragas glossary that Larraina in old Labourdin meant threshing-floor, aire, area. I suppose this explains the place-name Larraine in Soule which the French call Larrau. I am sending a copy of this glossary to the Société Ramond to appear in company with my St Jude which they are now printing, and I am adding the equivalents in French. On page 84 of Basme by Stăncescu. (Bucuresca 1893) the words cine stie ce would have done well for your recent pamphlet. Where do you mean to spend the summer? I suppose Priebsch will turn up here at the end of this month. Did I tell you that I had bought a copy of Larramendis grammar 1729 which looks as good as new? It cost 10 francs.
Yours
E. S. Dodgson. 
12 Rue de la Sorbonne, Paris. 18 June 1893.

 (note 1) I have long thought Slavonic gora = mountain, height, might be Basque.
