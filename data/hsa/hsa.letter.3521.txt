Banyuls sur Mer, Pyrénées Orientales. 4 Mars 1895 and until further notice.
Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
I sent you yesterday the new bit of my Concordance published at Bagnères de Bigorre. I received a tirage à part of 25 copies yesterday. I have to confess my responsability of 7 instead of 8 under 
Dirade and of act:, which must be cancelled, under etzedin. I find that in the manuscripts of all my other concordances zedin and cedin is correctly called the simple auxiliary and I hope my mention of Bonapartes work will save me from the charge of ignorance. But the printer is responsable for some other errors, indeed nearly all. In the 4 proofs which he sent me he had arranged the article as a brochure of 8 pages hence my cramping my remarks so much. But without consulting me he finally expanded it into 10 pages and a half, introducing some mistakes that were lacking in the proofs eg. cutting CIHARDUCANEAN in two & spoiling vous sçaurez under badaquiçuela & putting : before d’ecen under dituela. If he had only told me that I had 12 pages to occupy, I should have added something interesting and important at the end. I hope the severe winter has not hurt your health, and that you intend to let me hear of you and your writings from time to time.
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson.
