Légation de Libéria 
A HAÏTI 

London, August 22d 1890. 
 My dear Friend, 
I am since several days in London. I will leave to morrow for Leamington Warwickshire (note 1) to spend one day with my old friend Major R. Stuart (note 2) who was commander of the Bristish cavalry &amp; was 9 year minister resident in Hayti – From there I will go and spend two days in Liverpool with my son &amp; his five Children. I will be back in London Monday night – Wednesday night I will be in Ostend, Thursday at Bruxelles, and the 31st at Spa – On the 6 in Paris, 8 at Geneva, 9 at Berne, 12 at Paris. On the 14th I will leave to visit – le Midi de la France – On the 20 I will be back to Paris, on the 25 I will be back to Paris, on the 25 I will leave for New-York via Havre of Bordeaux – I will spend fifteen  days through America, (note 3) will embarked (sic) at Tempa for Key West &amp; Havanna and on the 20 of October I will be in Hayti – if God says so. My daughter Rose was married 5 years ago – she is a widow, with two children two years now – Corine was also married &amp; in February she became a widower [sic] after 14 months of marriage – but with (note 4) any child – so you see. I have been very unfortunate - &amp; my poor children also.
It is very unfortunate that we cannot shake hand together before I leave for Haïti – but we will be perhaps more fortunate in 92 – as I intend to visit Germany, Austria &amp; Russia.
With my best regards to your family, I remain, dear &amp; good friend very truly yours
J. J. Audain
