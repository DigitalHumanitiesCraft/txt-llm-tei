Dear Schuchardt,
I have long been thinking of writing to you but somehow I never could get over my laziness. With regard to my Myfanwy’s infantile pronunciation I fear I never put it down (at any rate I cannot find it now) on paper and I am now fast forgetting what it was; but with regard to ll I can state  for certain that she at first pronnced it ss: she said San for Llan, and I can well remember a time when I prononced every ll as ss. My wife’s early pronunciation was th thath for llall (cf. cylleth all over Wales for cyllell), but one of her sisters pronounced ll as ss and said arass for arall. I should say that most Welsh children up to five years of age or thereabouts pronounce ll as ss or th, mostly the former I think.
My children since they are in England here are fast forgetting Welsh as their early language: it is very difficult to prevent that though of course they can read and pronounce it perfectly and on account of it they have never had any trouble with the pronunciation of German consonants, exceph 
ch pal.l (note 1) I hear my friend Mr. Morfill (note 2) sometimes talking of your work on the borders of Slavonic. I am myself just now trying to get ready for the press  a small work on Celtic mythology. (note 3) Mrs. Rhys and Myfanwy wish to be kindly remembered to you. Myfanwy has a sister of ten, so we are four altogether. You will be sorry to hear that my wife has had a great deal of illness since we left Wales: she is pretty well just now
Yours very truly
John Rhys
