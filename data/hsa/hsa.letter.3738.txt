Dear Dr H. Schuchardt, 
I have had no communication from you since I found your fierce denunciation of the weather on passing through Vitoria. Since then I have written to you once or twice, and sent you some books. Since leaving the Asturias I have been through Rivadeo & the Vega de Riva d’Eo. The Eo river, as you know, forms the boundary between Galicia & the Atz-uria. Its name must be from ea-o = desembocadura de juncos in Basque, cf. 
ea on the coast of Biscaya & 
Orio at the mouth of the Oria. Its banks are nothing but 
rush-beds-ihi-tegi-bat. Thence I went by coach to Mindonium, now Mondoñedo, a dead Cathedral town which Basques may well have called mendioñ (or oin)-
eta. Thence I went to Betanzos (
Brigantia). It has a bridge like other places with the syllable brig in their names, but these are generally explained by burg. Whether Basque ohorzte as used by Leiçarraga comes from honore through ohore or not, you who have studied low latin, are better able to decide than I. At any rate I think the Romans used the term honores to express burial ceremonies, and ihorste, 
ehortsi etc: look like younger forms. But does any romance language use honorare in the sense of bury? I was at La Coruña for four days, & then 4 more at Santiago for the festival. To contrast with Bable en sin, which we discussed at München, I notice in the Calender Romontch (Mustér 1896) p. 32 en cullacigarra en bocca. In A Tecedeira de Boinaval, an historical novel in Gallego by canon Ferreiro (note 1), who shewed me the Calixtine Basque glossary in the archive of the Cathedral two years ago, p. 83. dicindo de si chegou reminds me of my critic in L'Avenia of Bayonne & his doubts about the verbal ending in nez. In the translation of the preface of Capánaga translate daguianerean thus "desde que pueden". This did, I believe, occur to me while preparing the edition. The erean is the rean of Micoleta & Capánaga, equivalent to rik, 
tik. cf: arik-eta – artean.
