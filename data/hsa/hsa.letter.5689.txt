Dear Friend,
As to the sea-coast it is now the height of the season about here and consequently dear to live, but a little inland you could have lodgings for from 10 to 15 shillings a week and perhaps you could live on 10 more but that of course would depend very much on your  way of living.
Perhaps Mr. Peters of Bala (note 1) could find you cheaper lodgings or even take you into his house if Mrs. Peter is now in good health: at Bala perhaps you would find the best 
Welsh in North Wales. I must see you before you go back but I hope to be back from Cornwall before the end of August. I shall not start probably for a week or so. So you can write here again and should I be going from here before  you start I shall ask some friends of mine to assist you in getting lodgings for you in the neighbourhood I have already mentioned to you if you should like it.
Yours truly
John Rhys
Rhyl
Aug.1. 1875
