Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
your card received tonight consoles me a little, especially as it is accompanied by a letter from the President of the Société Ramond promising at last to fulfil their promise to publish my text of the Pastorale de Se. Hélène, the task of copying which nearly killed me as Mr. Thomas knows – Your silence & that of this society and other bascophiles, and the fact that I have been robbed here of some of my Basque books has nearly driven me to suicide. I shall be adressable at Poste Restante, Oporto, till & after the 20th I expect to visit there the de Vasconcellos family to which I have introductions from Paul Meyer & Dr. E. Hübner & yourself. I shall be at Santiago de Compostela for the 25th St James day. I read all Leizarragas sermons & am reading Vinsons 93.a. which is better. 

E. S. Dodgson
