Colombo, 2 July 1890
My dear Sir,
By this mail I send you copies of a few Caffrinha songs, sent me by Mr W Goonetilleke of Kandy, who got the originals from a certain Solomon Christian. This man wrote them down, but all mixed up, and Mr G had some trouble in copying them out. I hope they will be of use to you.
Yours very truly

Donald Ferguson
