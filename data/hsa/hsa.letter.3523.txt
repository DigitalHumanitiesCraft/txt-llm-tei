Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
 I received your card today in company with a long letter from Doctor Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcellos who sends me with it her Portugiesischer Sprachführer just published. It seems useful, & is very pocketable. I do not think I have lost, but I cannot at this moment find, the last separatabdruck you sent, in which you give edergo and another word ending in go which are total strangers to me. Can they be correct? I hardly know what to write to you about as you ask me to spare you all that is unscientific, & I cannot make out what you mean by scientific. You have not answered my questions about gako & gache, gogora et à gogo etc: nor many others. Your dread of resemblances between words is to my mind a defect in your mental vision. Why are latin, Greek and Sanskrit classed as members of one family if not because they resemble each other? Resemblance is certainly a presumption in favour of community of origin. What a pity all languages were not formed under the supervision of an apostolic succession of omniscient & omnipresent Schuchardts, gifted with infallibility! How widely they would all differ! How little room they would leave for gropers like me to take erratic paths! P

Rhys is Principal of Jesus. Van Eys sent me The Academy of 16 Feb: containing his letter. I have got my Basque library today (note 1) really for the first time since Vizella. At Barcelona I (note 2) coud only make a partial use of it and, that only for a few weeks. 
 (note 3)Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson.
