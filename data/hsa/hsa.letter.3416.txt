Urbana, Illinois, November 29, 1912.Professor Hugo Schuchardt, Villa Malwine, Graz, Austria,
My dear Sir,
Accept my best thanks for the reprint of your article "Nubisch und Baskisch," (note 1) which has interested me most deeply, and which I should not have seen without your kindness, owing to the poverty of our library. The article is obviously of the first importance; I regret that complete ignorance of the languages involved deprives me of the right to express a more precise opinion. It is an inspiring if somewhat dispiriting excercise for young Romanists to contemplate the enormous range of learning displayed in such a study as the one you have had the goodness to send me. The note on zanahoria interested me als very much; there can be no doubt that you have suggested a much more acceptable base for the Arabic etymon than Dozy's pastinaca. (note 2) May I add that it is one of the highest satisfactions in a career not excessively rich in such things to receive at the hands of a scholar of your position courtesies of the sort you have just favored me with? 
Thanking you again most sincerely I am

Very truly yours,
[handschriftlich] D. S. Blondheim
