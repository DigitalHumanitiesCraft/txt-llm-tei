Dear Dr Schuchardt,
since the 27th I have been enjoying the blue sky & tranquil moony and sunny heat and cold of Sagium, which the clergy call Séez and the railway and the Post-office Sées. On the way from Paris on Monday I explored the agreeable towns of Dreux and Argentan. It is my first visit to the department of the Orne, in which the Comte de Charencey holds an ancestral property and is Conseiller Général. The department contains a village called Larré and another called Urou, the latter being on the banks of a river URE. To a Bascologist like you this is verbum Sapienti satis! The Iberian Basques must have been here before history begins. The Cathedral here is one of the lovely dreams of the 13th century, my century! I received today the first copies of my Concordance from Alençon, to which town I am going on foot on Monday. I have sent you a copy. I find a mistake which confounds me on page 6. I am made to say that Dacussana is imparf. I am sure I have never thought it to be anything but the present. I see also several other misprints which I do not think existed in my last proof. Please return the proof which I sent to you. Till the 8th, when I shall leave Alençon, my address will be Poste Restante there, deptOrne. The conclusion of this section of my severe task will I hope be out in May. You shall have it. It will contain a list of corrigenda. I appeal to you as a man of science for aid against those who are my enemies because I have sought the truth. (note 1)
