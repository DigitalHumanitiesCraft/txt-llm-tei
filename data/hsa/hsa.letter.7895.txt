 Mariatroststrasse 6. am Samstage 
Lieber Herr Hofrat!
Ich hätte Ihnen meinen Brief von Griffith (note 1) weiter lesen sollen, heute früh; da hätte ich gesehen – was ich vergessen habe – dass er sagt:
„Probably Prof. 
Reinisch (note 2) has a copy (d. h. vom Karanog Bande) (note 3). I am myself bankrupt of copies, both of this &amp; of the Meroitic Inscriptions,“
Sonst, bin ich überzeugt, hätte er Ihnen selbst ein Exemplar überreicht. Meine Frau bittet, für Ihre liebenswürdigen Glückwünsche  bestens zu danken. (note 4)
Ihr ganz ergebener
WECrum

Sprachforscher, ab 1873 Prof. in Wien; vgl. HSA 09191-09341; 09341A-09355.3 Griffith, Karanòg; the Meroitic inscriptions of shabl'ul and Karanòg, Philadelphia, Pa.: Univ. Museum ; 1911 (Eckley B. Coxe Junior Expediton to Nubia: Eckley B. Coxe Junior expedition to Nubia; 6).4 „The upheaval was his estrangement from his wife Ella, whom he married in 1896, and his falling in love with Margaret Hart-Davis (1876-1953), who was studying Egyptology at the time. This resulted in his loss of his post at the college in 1910, and his departure, with Hart-Davis, to Austria“:

Crum travelled to museums and libraries all over Europe collecting material, while still finding time to edit the texts from the Theban monastery of Epiphanius brought to him in 1911 by the American Egyptologist H. E. Winlock. When war broke out in 1914 the Crums were still in Austria, but Winlock persuaded the American state department to take up their case, and they were eventually allowed to leave. During the war Crum gave up half his income to charities and volunteered for work in the War Office. Afterwards he settled in Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, moving to Bath in 1927, where he was later joined by Thompson, who came to assist with the dictionary. This was eventually compiled from more than 240,000 slips. An earlier contract with the Berlin Academy having lapsed in the war, Crum reached an agreement with Oxford University Press in 1927 to share the cost of publication. It appeared in six parts (1929–39) and at once took rank as the definitive dictionary of the Coptic language.” (R. S. Simpson, „Crum, Walter Ewing [1865-1944]“, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography). – Crum spricht zwar immer von seiner Frau, aber Gestermann, „Adolf Ermann“ gibt dezidiert an, dass das Paar nicht verheiratet war
