Villa Reale, Bad-Ems, 8/19 1886
My dear Sir,
Will you kindly let me now where you will be about the 5th to 10th of the next month? I hope very much to be able to see you before I turn my face again toward America. I landed in England on July 25th and, after spending a little more than a week at 
Oxford and Cambridge, went directly from London to Heidelberg to be present at the Ceremonies of the Jubil√§um for two days, thence I came here, where I have been quietly resting ever since. My Cur ends toward the 5
th of Sept., when I hope to be able to meet some of my colleagues in these parts.
Hoping you are very well, I am yours most sincerely,
A.M.Elliott
