Weender Strasse 57

April 25. 1871 (note 1)
I am exceedingly obliged to you for the trouble you must have taken with my books they have just arrived in my rooms all safe and sound. I wrote a second note to you on Saturday I think. It was owing to the stupidity of the post office people: I had given them my address on Saturday morning but they never sent in your letter and some others for me that were there: Today as I expected  letters and none came I went there and found that my letters were there and had been kept there since Saturday. You are quite right in keeping the Barδ Cwsg you have; for they are quite the same all of 1865. (note 2) I will send you the Welsh Bible as soon as I am certain of your address. Anything you like to ask me in connection with Welsh I shall be delighted to answer as far as my knowledge goes. Welsh is not Stokes’ strong point: besides I do not think Stokes’ philology has improved in India at all. (note 3) I expect to have occasion to ask  you also many questions as soon as I get time to devote my attention to Welsh. I am going to work hard at Sanskrit this term. I shall have to pay Benfey (note 4) dearly for it: still it is the best plan for me now: I shall give it up after this term very likely.
I am glad to find they have a well supplied reading-room here that is a great comfort which I never had in Leipzig.
I have no news now about the University here as everything is still strange to me here.
Yours truly
J. Rhŷs

Do not mention anything about a bill I should be sorry to send you one for such a trifle.
