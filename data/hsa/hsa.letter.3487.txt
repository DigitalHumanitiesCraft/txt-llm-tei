Tavira, Algarve, 12 March 1894.
Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
you have not written to me for about two months. If you wish our correspondence to cease, say so with the franqueza Cristiana of the assassin of my valuable collection of Balearic newspapers, and I will “cease from troubling” you. I have many things to say unto you, but I fear you cannot bear them, though I bear them in mind. I am about to visit Cabo de S. Vicente, and to compare its topography, at the suggestion of Dr Emil Hübner, with what Avienus says of the Sacrum Promontorium. In Beira they pronounce Senhor like Italian Signore, down here like Italian Signoră. At Puebla de Guzman, in the Pa de Huelva, calostro is pronounced without the s. I have seen a dead 
alcaravan and eaten it, and a maçarico on the wing, and felt equally (note 1) disposed towards it.
E. S. Dodgson.
