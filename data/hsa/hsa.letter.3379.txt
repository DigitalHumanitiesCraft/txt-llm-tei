Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I received tonight your post card of the 24th Even when it is not damp it is difficult to write on these Portuguese Union Postale Universelle cards; for, as Van Eys has sagely remarked, they appear to be made of blotting paper! Your explanation of deusaneen, on page 109 in Capanaga, coincides with that of Arana (J. I.) and myself - If I did not mention that to you it was to be sure that I did not influence your judgement. Capanaga has the habit of writing s in the verb where modern Biscayans put ts. My printer says that my Capanaga (178 or 180 pages) will be ready before the 15th, so you will receive a Christmas present of a copy. If you can imitate Linschmann and De Charencey by buying ten others beforehand I shall be glad, for all the expense, and worry, and toil is borne by me alone. You coud easily sell them to Austrian Philologues. Van Eys is the only Bascologist who does not welcome my undertaking, except perhaps Mr D'Abbadie to whom I have sent all but the last 8 pages printed without receiving any answer. I sent about 12 days ago a letter to The Academy on the language of Capanaga. I know not yet if it has appeared. Can toca in Portuguese be a cousin of 
tóki in Basque? I do not think, as Van Eys does, that one can learn a language scientifically without visiting the contry [sic] where it is spoken.
