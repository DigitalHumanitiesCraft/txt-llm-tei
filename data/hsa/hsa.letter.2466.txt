Dear Dr Schuchardt
I knew you would accuse me of that “
Würtemberg“ instead of Baden, of which my conscience accused me so violently one minute after I had posted it, not as the result of ignorance but of sheer nervousness and the fact that I was thinking of asking you to address your answer to Ulm, that I nearly wrote another card on other words. I wonder you didnt also tell me that I wrote thumba instead of thumpa as a Basque word which I found in Salaberrys handy Navarrese wordbook. You know that in Rumonsch ent and enten mean “in” and “among = inter” - that seemed to me an additional reason for making indu = in negative in induperator = imperator. I find now that I ought to have sent you an inland postcard instead of a 10 pfennig one from Lörrach - how Euskarian it is to say 10 pfennig or mark instead of pluralizing the noun! – I find in Alemanish bisz = Basque biz = sei as in halabiz and aetiaita which I have long suspected of  being child or parent of Gothic atta & close to Irish - There is a good deal in this dialect that resembles our Anglosaxon curtness. I left Basel on Friday after exactly and etymologically a fortnight spent in exploring the environs. (If Belchen were not pronounced with ch = k (Balkan) I should feel sure it was Basque = black, swart, but the pronunciation may have changed owing to the orthography – Basilea, Urach, Atsenbach, Kandel (cf: Canigo = gañ-igo - cf: Igon a Basque village) = gain, gañ & others in Baden look like Basque words). Went by train to Lörrach whence on foot to Schopfheim where I saw the storks on the church & thought of Dante & his “cicognin” - thence by train to Todtnau and on foot to Feldberg-hôtel - on Saturday I went to the summit to see the sunrise, but the Alps did not chuse to shew themselves: Thence I walked to the Titi-see, & bathed in its inky waters, - thence walked to Freiburg by the  heavenly valley - After enjoying the glorious Cathedral & peeping at Fischers rock-denkmal in the University & listening to the military and garden bands, by the evening train to Neustadt, seeing the Titi by moon instead of sunlight - Neustadt has some 90 English speaking people but they didnt know at my inn what a poached egg is any more than in Spain! after France what a contrast is Catholic Baden, where one finds crucifixes in the very cafés & restaurants! not a bad one in my opinion since the irreligion of France produces so many horrid results - I cannot believe in a man who does not believe in a God and I cannot believe in a God if it is not Christ Crucified! - would that my life corresponded better with my belief! Yesterday I walked from Neustadt to Donaueschingen where I drank of the Donauquelle & bathed in the Brega where it joins the Brügg in the gardens of the  Prince zu Furstenberg, who is expected there on Thursday from Heiligenberg on this lake. I also visited the Museum. It is a pretty summer “thoking” place, as one says in Wykehamical slang. Yester even by train & songless (except train-noises) Singen - This morning as it was cloudy & had been raining - instead of going up Scheffels Hohentwyl I came by train to Schaffhausen, saw the falls, bathed in the town, & on by boat to Konstanz where I find your card. I had for company M
r G. Treherne (of Wales though his name is Cornish) & his wife & two daughters. I quite converted him to Euskarism - Here I shall be till the 5th Aug: I hope to meet you in the Tyrol, but will write again. Webster tells me that Mr & Mrs A. d’Abbadie are on their way to Ober-Ammergau - After at least a weeks fine & hot weather comes rain & thunder tonight. I asked Linschmann to send you Euskara, no 7. I shall walk all over Reichenau-iland. Some of this years Bayonne Basque publications have no printed original to serve as a translation. I think Mr Henry Gaidoz from whom I had a card this morning would like to have  (note 1) an article from you on the relations between Basque & Keltic for the Revue Celtique. I like to think that Victoria is but the latin of British Boadicea!
 (note 2) I remain very Euskaristically gratefully your “lerning-knight”

 (note 3)I wish someone would give me a good Edisonian phonograph and pay my fare through all the Basque villages to collect a phonetic record of the tongue.

t. Gallen would find me between 5 & 10 August. “ils languaigs vengian a calar,”
 (note 5) On the Gironde they still call a small boat curau which on my proposal Gaidoz accepted as the same as Irish curagh = boat.
