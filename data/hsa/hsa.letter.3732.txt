Hôtel Central, Biarritz. 2 June 1896.
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
numquam ne repones vexatus toties? In my Pentecostal effusion please read nagoela instead of ni nagola. Baña should be baina, as, faithful to Leiçarraga, I of course wrote it. I finished yesterday all the Basque part of my Concordance to the 830 forms of the verb in his version of St. Luke, except the definition of about a dozen which I have left open for Inchauspes decision. Of course I long to go to Paris and fill in this part of my work and that concerning the Apocalypse with the necessary quotations from Calvins French of 1565. A good many salmon were netted in the Adour at Bayonne this afternoon. I have long thought Basque izokin must be first kinsman to esox and the allied words in Ducange. The new library at Bayonne near the Post Office will be ready in about 18 months I believe. I hope it will be inaugurated under a new and better librarian. ProfrG. Paris has thanked me for my congratulations on his election to the Academy. I received today a novena in Bizcayan for St Antony of Padua just printed by F. Elosu at Durango. I expect to leave Biarritz next Monday I know not yet where for, but probably for 
Pau, where I think of giving the larger part of my library, except the Basque books, to the public library, as I cannot house them all. I have been here now more than 5 months, (note 1) a longer stay than I have made anywhere for ten years.

 (note 3) What is become of Priebsch?
I have been enjoying seabaths for the last 3 weeks.
