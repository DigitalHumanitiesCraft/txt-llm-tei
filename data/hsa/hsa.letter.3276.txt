Dear Dr. Schuchardt,
the March number of the Etudes Historiques et Religieuses du Diocèse de Bayonne, which I received from 
Pau on Saturday, contains a continuation of my Dechepare. The Editor tells me that my translation is barbare. Then why did he not request me to alter it? He sent me two sets of proofs. He particularly attacks je prie which occurs twice as the translation of othoy. The printer has slightly separated ya and çadaçu on the 2nd page. of course they ought to be joined. The Editor without consulting me has printed St. Jean le Vieux instead of St Michel le Vieux. Has he found out then that Dechepare went to that parish? also not understanding himself that 
çaquiztan contains mihi as indirect object, he has changed my “me profitiez” into “en profitiez”. I did not notice this in the proof. I hope he will go on with the rest of the religious part of this author. I have read all of Stempfs glossary down to the January number of the R. de L. which appeared only last Saturday. I find some misprints, some mistakes of definition, and a few eccentricities e.g. õ put in as a separate item. My Bascomania called my attention to 
εβασκαvε in Galatians just as it had to 
βασκ᾽ιθι in Homer, (note 1) to bascu a violet in Sard, to bask = very dry in Jamiesons Scottish Dictionary, to bask in English, to bask = together in Albanian, to basca = nausea in Spanish and hot in Sardinian, etc: etc: but I put it in partly to shew that Basque is a fascinating study, partly to incite the Basques to study Greek. few even of their clergy do so. J. I. de Arana knows it. Bréal says that the volume of his philological society for this year and next also is quite full, but that if I joined the society perhaps the committee would accept part of my work for later on I have finished Champneys History of English 1893, and am going on with Historical outlines of English syntax by Leon Kellner. I suppose gorri may be connected with goritzen since heat produces redness. In old Basque and in the writing of some unlearned people now I believe double rr and single r are interchanged. Euskara 13 will appear in April.
