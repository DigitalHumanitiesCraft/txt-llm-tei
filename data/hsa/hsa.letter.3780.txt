97 Kingsley Hotel, Hart Street, London. W. C. 21 January 1891 [sic].
Doctor Hugo Schuchardt, 
I have this evening seen for the first time your edition of the New Testament of Leiçarraga. A lady has presented it to me. The Athenaeum of Dec: 29, 1900 mentioned its appearance. I have been endeavouring to make it known; and, in spite of all your unfairness and discourtesy to mewards, I congratulate you on the conclusion of your task. I have your letter in which you asked me in 95 or early in 96 if I had enough money for a reprint at my own cost and other letters to prove that I had long before that done my best to persuade certain individuals and societies to undertake its publication, to say nothing of my remarks in the preface of one of the parts of my work on the Leiçarragan verb in 93 or 95. Your remarks about me in your preface are for the more part spiteful misrepresentations. I am not responsible for the blunders of the printers of the Revue de Linguistique and Euskara. Besides I often had to correct the proofs of my other publications without the presence of the original "Testamentu Berria".
E. S. Dodgson
