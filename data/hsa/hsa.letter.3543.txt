16 Sept: 1895.
Dear Professor Schuchardt, 
I shall be at Cambo at least till the 23rd & a letter for me directed here till the beginning of the next month would certainly be forwarded. You have not yet sent me any of your writings on Georgian. Profr. Carrière was thinking of starting a class for Georgian at the Ecole des Langues Orientales. I found your card on my return last night. On Thursday afternoon I walked from Ainhoua (note 1) to Elissondo (note 2) passing through Urdazubi (in Erdara Urdax). The people there think it means river & bridge for in the middle of the place two rivers meet and each has its bridge. On Friday I walked from Elisondo [sic] to Zumbilla (note 3) passing Yrurita (note 4), Oronoz, Mugaire, Oyeregi (note 5), Oronoz, Mugaire, Oyeregi (note 6), Navarte, San Esteban. The Valley of Baztan is the only part of the diocese of Pamplona where they preach & catechize in Basque. They call a peach Torashuna from Duracinum I believe explaining Tuasha as they call it in Labourdin. On Saturday I walked from Zumbilla (inn of San Tiburcio) to Irun & on by train to San Sebastian where I found Don J. G. Oregi rather more sensible than formerly. Yesterday I saw the royal family land in the concha after looking on at the regatta. I had a little chat with Marcelino Soroa y Lasa who has published a new book in two volumes. My finances are in a deplorable state. I know not when I shall be able to publish Micoleta. Mr Barwick of the British Museum offers to correct the proofs gratuitously.
E. S. Dodgson. 

DrLarrieu called on me here a few days ago and asked me to (note 7) tell you once more that he can let you have the Souletin (note 8) Imitation of 1757 if you write to him at Montfort L’amaury, Seine et Oise.
