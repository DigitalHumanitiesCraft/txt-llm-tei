Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I was very glad to get your letter a few days ago, the first news from you since the beginning of June in spite of my many notes posted in the Interval. I am sorry that Micoleta cannot be published in facsimile; because, in spite of what you say, it has evidently, as you will have to confess if you see the article I mean if possible to put in print upon the question; a paleographical value, that is also a philological landmark. The first 8 pages of the work were printed off today for better or worse. I met Mrs Doelter in the Cathedral here while I was thinking of you. She almost at once uttered your name, and I claimed acquaintance. Then I introduced her to Mr Rodriguez Marin, & he to Mr. Valdnebro. She has since written to both of them mentioning me, as they say; but not to me to whom she owes all they gave her. Is she back in Graz? Micoletas xs & gs with the French j sound are what I principally refer to. Also his mysterious sign (note 1) Ɩ. for ó = or apparently. 
 (note 2) Defend me in my solitary fight for Basque. 
 (note 3) I have Euskara No 17 and am sorry it is the last.
