Dear Professor Schuchardt, 
Mr Van Eys is responsible if my edition of Capanaga is at fault in those parts where the text is taken from his copy, which he revised. More than this, he inspected my copy of the book after I had filled it in from his revised autograph copy. I have changed artu into ortu = “huerto” because in the other place the text has ortu. I have sent my copy of the original to M
r. A. D’Abbadie, with two copies of the new edition. He has not acknowledged it any more than the other things sent by me to him since September 1892. Van Eys has never been very polite in his correspondences, nor very intelligent either, and now he expresses a whish to end it because he is ”disgusted at the incessant observations on everyone”. He is at liberty to publish all my correspondence if he likes. I have sent him one copy of my Capanaga. Half the edition of 466 copies is now disposed of, chiefly in gifts, & partly in payment of debts instead of money. If you can promote the sale of the remaining 233 copies I shall be thankful. You promised to say something beruhmend in my favour. On page 140 the original has daguiçun. I left out the n on purpose but kept it in the index. As for egun guren on the top of 148 you must find out if you can from Van Eys what it means. I took it entirely on his authority after questioning it. Do you think zaranza and 
homenzarrãs in Portuguese are Basque words. At San Martin a village near here they say bandera for vendera. Saa de Miranda seems from a copy of his works in the Library of the Lycée here to have been a contemporary of the cardinal who was King of Portugal for 2 years. He wrote Qu’emendo muito, & qu’emendando daño (os estrangeiros).
