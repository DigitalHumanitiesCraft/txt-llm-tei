SCHUCHARDT writes to us, regarding a paragraph about his literary labours which appeared in the Athenaeum:- “What I have in preparation is not so much a bibliography of the so-called Creole languages as a minute investigation of them, and I have not applied hitherto to the Imperial Academy of Vienna for assistance in this publication. Your notice, however, anticipates a request that I was about do address to your readers, viz., to assist me in my undertaking by hints and references to such of these dialects and such publications written in or about them as might easily escape my notice. Allow me to add that by Creole dialects I mean all such modification of European languages as have been developed in Extra-European countries by the influence of indigenous languages ; accordingly not only to the American and African negro-patois, but also Indo-Portuguese, Pidgin English, Pidgin French &c. Help of this kind may be found most easily in Great Britain, whose inhabitants are more familiar with the remotest quarters of the globe than those of any other country ; and I should feel very thankful for any suggestions“.5 Trübner's American, European, and Oriental Record.
