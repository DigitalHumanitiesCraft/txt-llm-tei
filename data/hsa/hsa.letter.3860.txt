New Orleans Feb. 24th /83
Dr. Hugo Schuchardt
Dear Sir,
I have your letter of January 29th only at the moment of departure from home, to be absent -at a great distance- for several weeks. I shall keep your letter before me, and will endeavor on reaching Baltimore to send you a scientific journal containing an article on the Creole Patois (note 1) which will give you far more information than will be furnished in my books.
Yours truly

As Mr. Cable dictated this, with several other letters, very hurriedly just before leaving home, he did not sign it. Respectfully
Mrs. G.W. Cable
