Kertch, October 15.1895
Dear Mr. Schuchardt,
I have been unable to write sooner to thank you for your post-card, and for your two interesting works. (note 1) I have read the latter with the attention they merit, and have derived much profit therefrom. It would be impertinent on my part to offer any criticism, even of a favourable Character, to so famous a philologist as You. I have, however, endeavoured to get my friends in the Caucasus to communicate with you  if they have any observations to make, or any additional material to furnish. Your energetic efforts will, I feel sure, make an epoch in the history of Georgian studies. 
One thing in your book (Über das Georgische), I must take exception to: You have referred to me in terms which are more flattering than correct; if, for instance, you had substituted Herr 
Arthur Leist’s (note 2) name for mine it would have been better.
Regarding to pronunciation of ჭ I must confess that the transliteration tš does not correspond with what I have heard. I began by pronouncing Tšavtšavadze, but was rebuked for it, and the nearest sound I can find ist precisely dch (dč) as in re
d church.
In reply to your question –  Giorgi Tsereteli (note 3) and his wife, Anastasia T. (note 4), edit Cvali and Dchedchili together. The translator of Shakespeare is Machabeli, (note 5) and Qifiani (note 6) has written some short Shakespearen sketches. Okromdchedeli (who has Russianised his name into Serebryakov) is alive, and a letter to the office of „Iveria“ would reach him. (note 7)
A month ago I sent my translation of Dodashvili’s article to Prof. Fr. Müller, (note 8) but I have not heard from him yet.
With kind regards,

Believe me,

Sincerely yours

Oliver Wardrop.
