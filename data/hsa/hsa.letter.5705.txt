I have had many letters and cards form Mr. D. (note 1) from time to time and most of them have never been answered. But since receiving your letter lately I have written to him to tell him that in case I wish to make known to you my opinion of your reviews I prefer doing so directly and not through him or any third person. I ought to have said that I do not know him at all.
J. Rhys.
