Cork (note 1) November 29, 1897 
To Dr Hugo Schuchardt in Graz, 
Sir, 
to punish you for all your unkindness to me I have resolved to add a note to my next publication requesting all persons finding your name in any of my printed writings to efface the same, as false to me and to Basque. 
I have also to request you to return to me all postcards and letters written by me to you under the delusion that you might be my friend. I will, on receiving them, pay you for the postage sending a post office order for the amount indicated by the stampage of the packet. I regret that I did not take the precaution of keeping copies of them, as your replies to some of them are  slightly dishonest, giving the impression to any reader but myself that I had been guilty of absurdities which were only coined in your own brain to annoy me.
MrJulien Vinson informs me that you have reported to him "the last trick I have played you". 
I should like to know what trick this may be. Is it a trick to warn a person off [sic] the edge of a cliff which he is in evident danger of unwittingly approaching and falling over? Would it be a trick on my part if, on hearing that a plot had been formed to assassinate you while out riding near Graz I warned you and the police at the same time? No! it would be my duty to give such warning. I feel that any man of common sense would say that I was quite right in writing to you and to the Secretary of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at Vienna as I did about a book upon which your reputation as a philological scholar, and its reputation as a patron of learning, will so greatly depend in the opinion of the next century. I have always thought that a new edition of Leiçarraga would be  an immense boon. I have had it in view as you know since 1889 at least, when I first saw the original, & when I began my Concordance to the Verb. I tried to persuade Mr A. d'Abbadie to pay for it. I believe I asked the French Minister of Education &c to do it. I recommended you four years ago to ask your own Academy to do so. You have succeeded. My scheme has borne fruit in your brain. You deserve my admiration and my thanks for your success. But I also have always thought that the edition ought to be either an exact facsimile page for page, line for line, word for word, letter  for letter, by photolithographic process with a list of the misprints & their corrections at the end: or, better still, A text free from the original misprints & of course without new & additional ones, & with a list at the end of the misprints. The latter kind of edition would be the more scholarly. Moreover it would shew off the skill of the editor to a greater extent. And it would be much more pleasant to read, much more useful especially for reading aloud to Basques. Think of reading ioan in a certain verse in St. Mark where it is certain eroan ought to be put in its place! I am a free man, Sir, and will express my opinions on all subjects when I please. I would tell you what I am saying now if you were the emperor of Austria or Queen Victoria. I believe I am right in saying that I saw the original of Leiçarraga before you did. I have since then kept my eyes open to find misprints so  as to make my concordance as useful as possible. Yet you think me impudent and 
arrogant for offering you, as a friend, the result of this minute study, with the only motive of making your work, which I am delighted to hear of, a real success! Your pride has blinded you. Beware lest it comes before a fall! May god enlighten you, and give me and Basque better friends than you, and save you from ever having a worse friend than myself! I trust that even now you will listen to reason and give us, what students want, a purified Leiçarraga. Surely thirty copies in Europe full of Hautins misprints are enough for dry-as-dust pedants. These misprints are a cause of bitterest tears to all who admire, as I do with my whole heart, the exceeding beauty of the authors language. They mar it horribly. N. B. in my edition of Timothy baitraucate on p. 40 & 48 is not masculine: that was an oversight due to haste of course. Please rectify it in your copy.
E. S. Dodgson. 

Professor J. Rhys, of Rhyddichin says he knows how brutal you can be.
