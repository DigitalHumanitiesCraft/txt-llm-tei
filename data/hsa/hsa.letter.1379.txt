39, Hornby [Road], Bombay,
 5.th May 1882.
My dear Sir,
I have had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 7.th January, to which I now beg to reply, asking you to excuse me for the delay, caused by the nature of the inquiries I had to institute concerning the works published in Indo-Portuguese dialects.
The Portuguese spoken in the Portuguese colonies of Goa, Damão and Diu is as pure as that of 
Lisbon. The dialects are spoken in the so called Portuguese Province of the North, now under the British rule, consisting of Thaná, (note 1)
Bassein (note 2) and the neighbourhood, the ancient Province of the South, also under the British, comprising Mangalore, 
Cochim [etc.], and Ceylon; Syngapure + Malacca. With the exception of the dialect of Ceylon, there is no work published in any other dialect. All these dialects are closely related, and that of Ceylon may be taken as the type of them. With regard to this latter dialect you have already all the work hitherto published, such as the New Testament, and are [aware] of the grammatical work on the subject. But you do not seem to possess the Livro de oraçãos, (note 3) published at 

Colombo in the Ceylon Indo-Portuguese dialect. A copy of this work I beg to present you now.
I shall be most happy to assist you in your interesting and valuable investigations, and shall be too glad to answer any other question you may in future deem it necessary to address to me.
Believe me, my dear Sir,

Yours very truly

J. Gerson da Cunha
