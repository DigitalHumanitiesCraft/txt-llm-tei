Hotel de la Gare, Cambo, B. P. 3 Sept: 1895.
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I am seeking an opportunity of giving you the credit of the first discovery of the origin of acheter. Am I right in supposing that gazna = cheese, comes form caseina or some such derivative of caseus? Have you or others already made this suggestion, or how came it into my head? I am expecting the 3rd proof of my collection of Basque inscriptions, and hope that my new Lei√ßarraga work will appear next month. I find the Cambo people explain the term min, as in adizkide min bat, ibaiaren minean, 
iguzkiaren minean, gau min minean, as properly meaning 
profond, deep. This makes me think it may be cousin to mine. At first, in connection with 
adizkide, I took it for the Germanic min = love. What say you? Where are you?
Yours
E. S. Dodgson.
