7 Getaria, San Sebastian. 9 May 1900. 
Dear Dr H. Schuchardt, 
I have received your assurances that you feel no 
groll towards me, and you certainly have no right to feel any towards a would-be friend. But your behaviour about my brochure offered to, & finally accepted by, your University, and all that you have written to or about me for three years past, shews that I cannot count you among my friends. I regret it very deeply, and only hope that you may repent & change your mind. METANOIA! Some Basque students would be glad to know when, & where, & at what price, your edition of Lei√ßarragas new Testament is to appear. I am unable to give any information on the subject, though I was the first to announce your project in a newspaper in Basqueland some years ago. I never received any prospectus of the edition. Of course I wish to promote its sale, & prepare the road for a good reception for it, even though I expect to find some small reasons for disagreeing with your manner of presenting the text to the public. You told me at Munich that Axular was the only Basque classic. I think Mendiburus book of 1747 is equal to it, though it does not quote classic authors. My edition of this will be on sale in a few days. A copy on superior paper, post free registered, shall be sent to you, if you let me have here a post office order, payable at Biarritz to the value of 5 marks.
E. S. Dodgson.
