Dear and Honoured Professor
Can you recall my name as your correspondent in the years 1882 – to 1887 on the subject of Creolische Sprache? if so may I venture to address you again. I am desirous to make a communication to the International Oriental Congress at Rome (note 1) in october on the subject of the „Birth and Death of Languages“.
Can you help me with a list of the works which you have  published on the subject, and tell me at what Bookseller in London or elsewhere I could get copies. I wish to know your latest views. I presented my copies of your valuable Creolishe Sprache to the British Museum – there were five (5) parts. Have you published any further ones? I venture to send you a copy of an interesting book – we have now translations oft he Bible in four hundred (400) languages, and we have to deal practically with languages, which are dying, and with new languages which are coming into existence.
If you have desire for any translation of the Bible, a Grammar a Vocabulary, I shall be happy to send this –
The death of my dear friends Fried Müller (note 2) and Bühler (note 3) have filled me with grief –
Yours reminiscent (??)

I include the last Post Card received from you, that it may recall to you my name.
