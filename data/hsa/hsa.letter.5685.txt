I am going to surprise you. I have to leave here in a few days. I have just accepted an inspectorship of schools in Wales. It is good pay but I do not yet know how much time is left to one for one’s own studies. I hope you have had my last note addressed to Gotha but as  I am doubtful about it I will not send the Bible till I hear from you I shall not be leaving till Tuesday or Wednesday I think I hope this change in my whereabouts will make no difference whatever in our correspondence. Would you favour me with a word in a day or two.
I remain

Yours very truly

J. Rhŷs
