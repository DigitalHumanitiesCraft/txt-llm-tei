Dear Dr. Schuchardt,
I need nothing so much as a friendly critic like you with an interest in Basque, for I am, at least here, like the peak of the Maladetta in a state of too serene and chilly isolation. I see Dr 
Larrieu occasionally but he is not much of a philologist and only knows Souletin well. My Bas Navarrais student (medical) is a young savage and we have quarrelled. In my last card read sulphonal - I must have been thinking of Basque lan. In another card strike out the accent on deçala, for the accent makes it a 2nd person. You see I have a literary conscience which awakes too late always! Best thanks for writing to G. Paris. I passed him yesterday in the gloomy portal of the Hautes Etudes but did not dare to speak. He always looks so severe! I will however break the ice now armed with your letter. I have hitherto felt like an interloper in the H. E. for they have never given me a carte d’étudiant there and I have made no pretense of doing any work for Duvau, 
Gaidoz, 
Morel Fatio, or Paris, or Psichari, whose classes I have from time to time followed. But I see in the annuaire that they enroll me in their list of members. I have corrected the 4th and I suppose final proofs of my Concordance to the part of St John of which you will shortly have the separatabdruck. I can only send you today the 3rd proof. My Esthonian teacher says that a belle mère is called in his language emaste. impossible not to think of Basque. So too einhe the shepherds gônter or luncheon is very like Basque ainhu the shepherds pittance!
 (note 1)Those words of Carboni are not in Spano. More of my Dechepare is soon to appear in the Etudes at Pau. have you Peru Abarca? tell me! it is worth studying and is still on sale at Bilbao.
E. S. Dodgson.
