Hôtel Cadete, Vizeu, Portugal. 22 Dec: 1893.
Dear Dr Schuchardt
 I received tonight your letter replying to my card of the 12th so we are only ten days apart postally! After the 31st when I leave for Hotel Do Caminho de Ferro, Coimbra, you must address me thither of course. As it is too late to wish you a Merry Christmas let me wish you a Happy New Year, and may it not be the last. I trust that you will be able to publish in 1901 an Etymological Dictionary of the Basque language. Before that you must travel in Finland, in 
Armenia, in Persia, and the north of Africa. You do not answer my suggestions about 
deitze and zitzarra. 203 copies of my Capanaga will have left Vizeu tomorrow morning, for The United States, Spain, France, Austria, Italy, Germany, and England. The registration of all packets containing more than one copy makes the postage very heavy. My printer made a blunder, and so instead of 500 copies the edition consists only of 466 complete copies. The binding in paper of 462 of these comes to 6730 reis. I paid the printer on the 12th the last part of the sum of 52900 reis. He has since returned 3600 reis. The whole affair will be a dead loss to me. Where I say Bizcaïno, y primer, read Bizcaïno, y segundo.
Vale. 
Agur. 
E. S. Dodgson. 

 (note 1) I sent the original of Capanaga to Mr A. D’Abbadie
