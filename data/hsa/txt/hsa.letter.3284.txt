Dear Dr Schuchardt,
I find that 
VinsonsPetites Oeuvres Basques de Sylvain Pouvreau is as I anticipated full of misprints as are all his other books. I shall ask Linschmann to publish a list of them in Euskara number 14. It is regrettable that that newspaper does not appear more frequently. That is due to the fewness of the subscribers. I have today looked through at the Bibliothèque Nationale “An Ainu, English, Japanese Dictionary and Grammar”. I find very few words which have a Basquelike appearance and at the same time a similar meaning. Luzac & Co, Oriental booksellers of 46 Great Russell Street, London. W.C. whom I have requested to send you their catalogue announce a new edition of this interesting volume. MrLlewelyn Thomas says that his edition of D’Urte is already at press. I have found in writing out my slips for concordancing the first epistle to the Corinthians more, and more careless, misprints than in any other part of the epistles. I shall tomorrow have finished this slippery task and begin the 2nd to Corinthians. I shall then be able to leave Paris with my register of all the cases of the verb in all the Epistles. I propose to start for Roncal on July the 12
th. There is many a slip twixt cup and lip. Arana speaks to me in a long letter in Guipuzcoan of a Basque Dictionary by one Aizpitarte. He also sends me a tracing of the title page of “Justuen Ispillu Arguia Santuen Erretrato bicia: santucho gazte biren, S. Luis ta S. Estanislaoren miragarrizco bicitzaren berrion laburrac eta santucho gozo bien bederatziurrenac gazteen probechuraco Jesusen Compañiaco A. Agustin Cardaberazec ematen dituenac. 1764. urtean. Bear dan bezala Iruñeco: Antonio Castillanen echean”, of which Vinson makes no mention. The weather is still very bask. I shall shortly give you Batchelors version of the 3 last gospels in Ainu.
Yours faithfully
E. S. Dodgson.
