Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
the printers at Alençon sent off some copies of my new book on Leiçarraga on the 18th, but by colis postal, instead of simple post, so that I only got them today, and shall not be able to register any packets of them till 9 tomorrow morning; as the postal arrangements are so arranged here as to give the public the greatest amount and the employés the least of trouble. Notice the corrigenda at addenda before criticising me. The corrections in the preface at the end were, I feel sure, with one exception indicated by me on the last proof, but, it seems, in vain. I received today a visit from a very distinguished and modest Bizcayan priest, Don J. M. de Bernaola, of Durango. He and another priest Don Ezekiel Echebarria, of Ermua, the author of an immense unpublished manuscript on the Bizcayan verb would I think give you better information than Azkue. I hope to send you the inscriptions in January. I understand the first part will appear in the December number of the Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia. Your work on Georgian soars far above my powers of vision, like an eagle on the Caucasus.
Yours
E. S. Dodgson.
