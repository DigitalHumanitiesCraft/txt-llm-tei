Santander 28 June 1896. 
Dear Dr. Schuckardt [sic]
your last card reached me in Victoria last Wednesday week after a few days spent in visiting some places in the provinces of Navarra and Logroño where I had never been before, and where it is evident that Basque flourished formerly. I might write much, but limit myself to this card to say you have not yet answered some of my questions. It is pleasant to pass ones reflexions through the sieve of the mind of another who takes an interest in the same studies. My next address will be lista, Gijon, Pa de Oviedo. I start tomorrow morning for Cabezon by railway, and shall try to see some places in this province near there before joining the Oviedo railway at Infiesto. I met here two days ago a Souletin from Barcus who says they have there a word kota meaning a kind of dress. It must be English coat. I dare say it has long since been suggested that Basque 
jabe, pronounced kabe by some is related to German and latin 
habe. What do you say? and Basque abe, 
abi is it not the root of latin abies? the column-tree? J. M. de Bernaola has found in the possession of another priest at Durango another ms copy of Peru Abarca, taken before the text was printed, & differing here and there from his. In this the word on which Campion gives a note in his grammar is the ordinary me vienen á mí, without tutoiement. He says the common people have turned anniversariua into arimen-errosarioa and reumatismua into erre-bautismua! I am glad you share my view about ezetz & baietz. I announced it in reviewing Azkue in 1892. His Bishop has refused his licence to two of his books, one a catechism. 
 (note 1)Yours
E. S. Dodgson.
