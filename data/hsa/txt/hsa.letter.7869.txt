Dear Sir/
I think it best to send back at once your valuable paper on St Thomas Patois – I took it to Dr 
Rost, (note 1) and we agree that it would not do for the Journal of the RAS (note 2) – I asked whether the Anthropological Institute would have it, but it appears to be outside their orbit also.
To me it is of great interest and as you are sure of the pages oft he Vienna Academy please let me have an early  Separat-Abdruck.
The Meetings of the RAS have ceased until next November: so i could not even bring the matter forward till that time which would be a bad delay.
On the whole I think that it will be better for you to print in the Academy, (note 3) and then get it noticed in English papers.
I am very grateful for your promised Kurze Darstellung  von der afrikanische Patois for my book: it will be a great addition to my work. (note 4)
I will try and find some West Indian correspondent for you
Yours truly
Robert Cust

Der Gegenstand von Schuchardts Artikel passt allerdings nicht wirklich zum Profil der Zeitschrift: “The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society has been published by the Society since 1834 and is distinguished not only by its longevity but also by its consistency in providing a forum for scholarly articles of the highest quality on South Asia, the Middle East (together with North Africa and Ethiopia), Central Asia, East Asia and South-East Asia. It publishes articles on history, archaeology, literature, language, religion and art, and reviews of books in these fields“.3 Schuchardt, „Kreolische Studien I. Ueber das Negerportugiesische von S. Thomé (Westafrika)“, Sitzungsberichte der philosophisch-historischen Classe der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften. Wien 101, 1882, 889-917.4 Cust, A sketch of the modern languages of Africa, London: Trübner, 1883 (Trübner’s oriental series) enthält diesen Zusatz nicht. Schuchardt wird auf den S. xiii u. 48 erwähnt.
