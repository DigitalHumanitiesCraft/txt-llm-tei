Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
your card of the 12th arrived tonight. I received on the 8thEuskara 14, falsely dated like its predecessors. The priests 
Maurice Harriet and J. I. de Arana had already told me what you say therein about Elbico. Thomas tells me you share my objection to seeing proofs bearing Vinsons pattes-de-mouche. Dubarat tells me that my edition of Dechepare will not go on in his Etudes before January. Your opinion about nachacho confirms mine. I have registered just over 500 forms of the verb in Capanaga. I think I wrote to you or Vinson just after it was given me in 1891 that I thought it would contain 500 forms. I wish to know by return of post if youplease what you think about deusaneen (it looks more like deusancen) in the following lines of Capanaga “Ea emonbaga edugui daben bear eguin deusaneen aloguera edo salarioa criaduena” = “si ha tenido el jornal, o salario de los criados.” Is it “for that which they have (or have had) to do for him” (in which case why is it not eguin bear?)? or is it “which he ought to 
give to them”, when again one asks why bear precedes eguin; or is it 
beareguin = task, devoir, duty, bounden labour, a substantive, or is it bear cen eguin deusan which it was his duty that he sh. give
