Venecia, Rioja, Sevilla. 31 December 1896.
Dear Dr. Hugo Schuchardt, 
these are to wish you a happy new year. Mr Fo Rodriguez Marin was surprised and vexed at your not keeping your word, as I have it in your last letter, about sending him a letter for Christmas Eve. I think my edition of Micoleta will be ready before the 20th of January; but the printer is a devil. Can you do nothing to bring about the buying for some continental library the books of Prince L. L. Bonaparte, which are on sale en bloc chez H. S. Nicholls, 3 Soho Square, London. W.? Their dispersal would be a crime upon the head of entire Europe. Can you do nothing to help me about the distributing of my supplement to the Proverbs? Campion who has sent me his last book, & Harriet have it in their copies of the Van Eysian edition. You must add 61 to the numbers under DA & AROA 9. to the list of forms, and change 4 into 6 in their sum.
E. S. Dodgson. 

 (note 1) I lately met the two misses Beraztegi who told me that their grandfather Don (note 2) Pedro Novia de Salcedo did not know Basque. So I always thought.  (note 3)You have said nothing yet in your printed writings to help me as a Basque student and publisher. This is not what I expected of you.
