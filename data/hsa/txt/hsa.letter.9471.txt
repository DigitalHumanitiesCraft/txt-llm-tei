N° 3447. 6.12.01.
Dear Sir,
In answer to your letter I beg to say that the spindle with the whorl (note 1) below is not in the Museum. In N° 6477 the spiral cut is fort he wool, and all the B. M. spindles have this spiral cut.
In N° 6480 the whorl is at the top oft he stick. It has on it still a great deal of „fil de lin“. (note 2) N° 12541 has still a small piece. We also have a spindle which does not seem to have had a whorl upon it.
I am,
 Dear Sir,
 yours faithfully
