7 Plaza de San Fernando, Sevilla. 10 January 1897.
Dear Dr H. Schuchardt, 
I got your letter of the 3rd only tonight. The above will be my address from tomorrow afternoon till further notice. Tomorrow I have to call on the British Consul to ask for the help, which Fo R. M. denies, against my printer. It would be too long to give you here all the details of the quarrel: but as I chose the printer on the recommendation of Don F. R. M. who accompanied me in making the first and then the reduced contract, which I foolishly (but out of respect for F. R. M. who told me the man was de confianza) only had partially put in writing, I feel hurt at his deserting me at the last moment, as I feel sure his conscience must tell him, I am right. If I cannot get it settled by the Consul, I shall appeal to the public in some newspaper, and quote your last kind letter, as I have no bascologists here to defend me, though a good many have written applauding my Micoleta. My patient correspondent Mr Barwick, who is correcting this week the final proofs of the two final 
pliegos, pp 17-32, does not know Basque. It is clear from the MS that M. never revised it himself, or as it seems from the grammar, that he knew Basque very little. I met here lately two granddaughters of Novia de Salcedo. They told me he too knew not Basque. So I always thought. When I first read at Barna in 96 the first edition of M. I thought Ɩ. must be vel. But elsewhere he puts o, and uses no latin.
Servus.

 (note 1)I have bought a copy of the first edition of Larramendis (note 2) Dictionary for 42 pesetas. It contains a supplement by Goitiandia (1754) (note 3) which I shall soon put #.

Mr. H.S. Nicholls, bookseller of 3 Soho Square, London, wrote to me saying Frau Dolter did not go to the houses of the two andalucians and only met them in my presence.
Can you do nothing with 
Van Eys for me in the matter of distributing my yellow index!
In that add AROA. 9. and insert 61 under DA.
I hope you have a good vergrösserungsglas.
