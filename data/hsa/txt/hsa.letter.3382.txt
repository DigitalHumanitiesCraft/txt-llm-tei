Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
my book has been printed off down to page 168 which includes part of my appendix to the text of Capanaga. There remain some ten pages to finish. My printer makes me suffer terribly. As I am now compiling a 3rd part of my supplement to 
Vinson which I hope will be accepted by the Revue des Bibliothèques for Jannuary I should be glad if you would lend me your copy of Galice on Moeurs Basques, or at least send me a description giving the title in full & the number of the pages, stating which bear anything in Basque. What is the price of it? Quaritch has sent me a few of Prince Luciens editions of Basque texts. I think you would like to read Hazparneko Calvarioa mentioned in my supplement, especially Mr. Arnaud Abbadies sermons. I am about to attack Lizarragas sermons which are said to be one of the best books in Guipuzcoan. How do you derive Basque deitze the action of milking a cow? What do you learn from Hübners Iberian Inscriptions? Van Eys says we want Bascologists like you and 
Uhlenbeck, but defends the latter against my complaint that he had never been in Basqueland by saying that it is possible to learn a language scientifically without going into the region where it is spoken. I do not think that you are of this opinion after your journeys to Wales and the Basque provinces. Where is 
Priebsch? I should like to send him my Capanaga.
Yours faithfully
E. S. Dodgson. 
Hotel Cadete, Vizeu, 11 December 1893.
