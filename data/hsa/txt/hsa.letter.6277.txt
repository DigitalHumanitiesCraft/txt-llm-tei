March I / 84.
Dear Sir,
I am very sorry that you have not before received an acknowledgement of your letter & of the two monographs you have been kind enough to send me. But I am only just returned from Upper Egypt, where I have been travelling without any fixed address, so that nothing could be forwarded to me. I have been studying your monographs with the deepest interest. Like yourself I feel convinced that answers to several of the questions of the Science of Language will be found in the study of jargons or mixed dialects. Any #[fast?] light thrown upon them will therefore be of high value.
I hope to bring your monographs  before the notice of the readers of the Academy (note 1), as soon as the Editor will allow me space for doing so.
Yours faithfully
A. H. Sayce.
