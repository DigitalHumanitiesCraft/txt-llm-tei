Dear Dr Schuchardt,
many thanks for your postcard and your article on Giacominos theories about Basque and Hamitic Egyptian which I received today. I expect to reach the Hôtel du Collége de France, Rue de la Sorbonne, 
Paris, on the 12th. I despatched to Paris yesterday my second supplement to Vinson for the Revue des Bibliothèques. It will I think be longer than the first, and I have already got some new matter to add when I correct the proofs. I was present on the 15th of October at the opening lecture of Professor Azkue at the Instituto de Bizcaya for this semester. 4 boys and one old man. He sticks to his deadly error about dai etc: He says that this form and the other two of the present tense singular of the indicative of izan are used at Mundaca, but though I passed through that village 5 or 6 times, and talked much about Basque while staying for some weeks at Bermeo close by, I never heard of this phenomenon. I have nearly finished my English version of the pastoral of St. Helen, the 1300 lines of which I have copied during this vacation - in it there are some 30 cases of what I can only call the Béarnais 
la, that is not the la of the “forme régie positive” of 
Inchauspe, nor the la which I call “participial”, synonymous with 
laric, but a la with no more apparent raison-d’être than the superfluous que which always precedes the verb in Béarnais - This does not exist in any other Basque dialects, and shews the enormous influence of the Manechs upon their Souletin despisers. I have heard used with my own ears, in the mouths of Bizcayans and Guipuzcoans the word enda as a synonym of 
eta. It seems chiefly used at the beginning of sentences, and reminds one of Icelandic and Dutchen, English and and German und. I sent some months ago to 
Linschmann a list of Armenian words very like Basqueteghi, now sounded tehri, meaning place is one of them - 
Arzac has promised to reprint 
Capanaga in the next volume of the Euskalerria, but he does not always keep his word - I called on Consul Sprenger at Donostia and found him aimiable. Mr. Webster has been much better lately. I see Canon 
Adema almost daily (38 Rue des Basques).
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson.

Bayonne, 4 November 1892.
 (note 1) The translation of the opening of the Chanson de Roland made for me by the abbé 
Piarres Harizpe is very bad indeed.
