My dear Sir,
Your kind favor of Nov. 15th is just received. Please accept my best thanks for the same.
I hope, without doubt, to have the pleasure & great honor of meeting you next summer. I assure you that a personal acquaintance on my part would be most highly esteemed.
Your “über Schurri murri n. s. w. [sic]“ (note 1) never reached me. I should be delighted to have it, if you still have extra copies. Such writing as yours is what we need extremely in America & I assure you that you are doing a fine missionary labor, not only for Europe but America.
I am looking forward with great pleasure to your “ (note 2) which I shall gladly notice.  We are now at work on the first number of “Modern Language Notes”, (note 3) a monthly publication in which we shall be able to make all such matters as these known extensively among our colleagues in the United States.
I am now at work on my second article on the Canadian Language, (note 4) where I treat the strong external influences (social, religious + civil) that had a tendency to produce a homogenous speech in that country.
I regret, my dear Sir, to hear that you are not very well. I have also been a great sufferer from neurasthenia, but fortunately now am much better from the liberal use of cold baths, the only thing that  has ever helped me much.
Yours very sincerely,
A. M. Elliott
