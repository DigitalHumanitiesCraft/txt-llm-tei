Hôtel Central, Biarritz, B. P. 28 February 1896. 
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I shall send you tonight or tomorrow two numbers of L'Avenir (de Bayonne) in which you are spoken of by me, and 1 by a Gascon who remains unknown. You will see the disastrous results of your most unkind neglect to say a word in favour either of my Capanaga or my Leiçarraga works. Van Eys has written me a very unaimiable letter signifying that I had better not call on him if I go to San Remo. As I owed my first knowledge of Basque to him, Jan: 1886, though I had bought some 6 or 7 years before some of the gospels in Basque published by the Bible Society, out of curiosity, I naturally wished to make his acquaintance. You said you found him sehr liebenswurdig. Many of his letters to me have seemed so also, and he has made me some handsome presents; and my letters to him would shew not servility but respect, only bounded by higher respect for scientific truth. Quite lately I put a complimentary notice of his projected edition of the proverbs in the 
NoticiersBilbains. Has the book been published or not? Vinson also has been very disagreeable & selfseeking. On the whole my Bascological experiences have not been agreeable. I have to pay 100 pesetas for as many copies of my inscriptionsBasques. I shall have them in about a week. I shall sell a few for 2 f 50 c each, and give the rest away "hoping for nothing in return".
