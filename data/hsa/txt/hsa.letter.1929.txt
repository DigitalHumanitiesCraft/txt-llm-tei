Colombo, Ceylon
24 October 1888
Dear Sir,
I send you a little book just published here, in which you will find two Indo-Portuguese songs, with the music. These are the best known of the kind, and you may like to reproduce them in any book you write on the subject. If any other appears, I shall send it to you.
Yours sincerely

Donald Ferguson
