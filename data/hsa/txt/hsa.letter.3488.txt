Dear Doctor Hugo Schuchardt, of Graz, 
I have decided to publish, as soon as I can save money enough, the letters that I received about Basque from Bascophiles and Basque haters, yours among the number, even if you prohibit me, since you have ceased through jealousy or otherwise to write to me. I regret bitterly that you cannot be my friend, or that the religion of Jesus seems to have so little influence with you. I have been and am suffering from a bad foot that began to afflict me at the beginning of March. I received on Saturday the April number of the Etudes Historiques et Religieuses du Diocèse de Bayonne with continuation of my edition of Dechepare, and on Sunday the December number of the Revue des Bibliothèques containing the 3rd part of my supplement to Vinson. It has some misprints, for which I am not responsible, as they only sent me one set of proofs. They have not sent any tirage à part, or you should have it.
