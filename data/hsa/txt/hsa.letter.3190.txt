Do not be angry, or think that I claim to be a scientific man like you. If Basqueozka is from absecare I should like to find an old or dialectal form auzka - would English notch be from hoche? compare newt from “an ewt” or “eft”! I shall reply to 
Meyer and quote your remarks on this word and silvaticus – about the latter you support me, for referring to salvai in Girard de Roussillon, which he said in class coud not be explained, I told him the Basque had received it in that form. He wrote back that salvai or salbai coud only come from salvadius, which never I think existed! I must say that many leading philologists seem to 
enslave themselves to imagined hard and fast rules, whereas languages have been corrupted, and misshapen, by popular ignorancelawlessness and caprice – What law makes 
finem masculine in 
Spanish but feminine in Gaulish? You seem to make passiv and intransitive as applied to the Basque verb the reverse of synonymous. What think you of my supplement? My poverty affects my health and hinders my studies.
