Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I left Coimbra on the 24th, and after a night at Thomar, a most interesting place on the Nabão, arrived here on the 26th with an Englishman who is paying my expenses and profiting by my slight knowledge of Portuguese. My address will be till the 11th of Feb: Lista dos Correios, FARO, Algarve, Portugal. I made the acquaintance today of M
r. João Leite de Vasconcellos in the Bibliotheca Nacional, and there also of Monumenta Linguae Ibericae. How MrWebster can pass as an honest man what is there said of him I do not know. First he is not the only English enquirer into Basque, and secondly he knows so little of it that, as MrThomas put to the test, he cannot translate a sentence of easy Basque in the Eskualduna. Vinson has accepted a short article of mine on Capanagas language for, I believe, the next number of the R. de L. are 
zaranza and homem-zarrão from 
zar in Basque. 
Vasconcellos thinks the latter is from arr = male & the 
z a euphonic link. Are you well? I have nearly finished Moeurs Basques.
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson. 
Lisbon, 30 Jan: 1894.
