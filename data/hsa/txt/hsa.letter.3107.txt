Dear Sir,
I was glad to get your card some days ago here in Sassari, which the peasants still call by its ancient name of Tatari. I have visited many villages & the Cathedral cities of Tempio & Castel Sardo on feet since landing in the iland on the morning of April 26, but I have been by rail over the bits between Terranova and Calangianus & between Porto Torres & this capital. Of course I find in the University Library many books of interest about the antiquities & the language of the Sards. I send you today a corrected copy of my last venture in print. Please criticise it without mercy. I have several hundreds of the incorrect copy to be sold, I hope, this autumn in 
Basqueland. Shall I meet you there? I might perhaps give up my wanderings if I coud find a nice Basque wife But on my present income I can neither marry nor travel with much comfort - Yet how much one learns in moving about and especially on foot! and how nice it would be to have children chattering in good Euskara! Several facts in this iland contribute to confirm me in my etymology of latin turris Greek τυρρις or τυρσις from Basqueiturri - E. g. the runaghe as they call them in the north were towers & are all near a fountain or a river (in africa there is at least one river called ituri) & so are the villages which have turris, turri, torre, torres as their name.
Auf wiedersehen. Lebewohl -
