 Islington

London N.
 July 23rd 1883

Dear Sir,
I was away from London for a few days &amp; only just returned.
With respect to the important subject of your kind letter, I can give you no information on the ,secret-lingo‘ spoken of, except that on certain occasions, words are formed by a certain clique which defy any analogies from  given roots in the language, &amp; the meaning attached to them arbitrary, &amp; only understood by those who found them. I suppose the words given by you belong to the same category. Not knowing Calabar, (note 1) I cannot of course speak with certainty about them.
With kind regards.
 Believe me
 Yrs respetfully
