Dear Dr. Schuchardt,
I was very glad to get your letter, that is postcard, tonight and to learn that the printing of your work is advancing so well. As soon as my tirage à part arrives I will send you a copy. I leave Paris on Monday for a week in the Cathedral city of Seez in the Orne and then I go for another week to Alençon in the same department where my work has been & is being printed. De Charencey lives near there. 9 kilos off is a village of which at least the modern name Larré looks like Basque. I suppose di in 
daidi to be potential. the indicative present singular both in Leiçarraga and in Biscayan is for the third person 
dagui. Campion is a member of the New Cortes, elected by the fueristas and Catholics of Pompilona or Iruñ (bonne ville de Pompée). He is going very soon to Donostia and will attack 
Arzác about his infidelity to me and Capanaga. Vinson in the R. de L. published on Saturday repeats his false statement that Basque has neither a future tense nor a relative pronoun. He publishes at the same time some texts in which he points out the future! and in which one sees the relatives z
ein and n he translates devot içatea erranda (probably for errenda) dieçaçuentçat by afin qu’il vous dise d'être encore etc: It means of course ”in order that it may render your devout state (or nature) yet more devout”. Dido now says that emazte is only an (note 1) adjective of emak = marâtre, that is = step[m]otherly.
