Hôtel Metropole, Cork. 15 November, 1897. 
Dear Dr H. Schuchardt, 
I hope to publish here next Friday, when I shall be 40 years old, the first Basque book printed in Ireland. The Athenaeum of last Saturday announces that you are to publish your Leiçarraga under the auspices of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. You will remember that when I congratulated you on your election to that body I asked you to use your influence to obtain that privilege. I congratulate you on your success. I feel it my duty out of reverence for Leiçarraga, for the New Testament, for the Basque Language, for scientific truth and honesty, to warn you against reproducing the verynumerous misprints of the original. I offer you my services to help you to detect them. Posterity will blame you if you reject my advice.
E. S. Dodgson.
