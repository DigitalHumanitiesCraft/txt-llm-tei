My dear Prof. Schuchardt,
Your card of Sep. 25th was duly received. Mr. Benjamin Sulte (note 1) is an employee in one of the Canadian Goverment [sic] Bureaus, at Ottawa. He knows nothing about language, except as a general historian. He is considered one of the best young historians in Canada and is a great producer in that Department. His article (note 2), to which you refer, is wholly unscientific and superficial. I have just begun to publish the preliminary parts of my work on Canada, (note 3) which I shall send you as soon as they appear. I have spent a part of my summer in the maritime provinces (Cape Breton, Isle Madame & Nova Scotia) of Canada, and have collected a large amount of supplementary material on the French Acadian languages, which I propose to use in my work.  I was in Germany in July and expected fully to see you, but was detained at Ems (note 4) longer than I had thought to be when I left home. I hope next summer to be able to see you somewhere over there.
Hoping you are very well, I am, as ever,

Yours very sincerely,

A. M. Elliott
