Dear D r Schuchardt,
I have never ventured to make the acquaintance of M rGaston Paris the Director of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes though I hear him there and at the College de France and admire his learning. I know M rE. Chatelain the Secretary of the Hautes Etudes and he has promised very kindly to submit to M r. G. Paris next Friday that portion of my Analytical Concordance which covers the 
Leiçarragan verb in the two epistles of S t Paul to S t Timothy – I have already offered the manuscript to M rGaston Paris for the publication of the Hautes Etudes, but he did not even answer my letter – Will you kindly write to him at once, to the Ecole des Hautes Etudes dans la 
Sorbonne, and recommend my work as worth publishing? I am most anxious to push forward the work during the health of Inchauspe who was born in 1815, and who is willing to revise my definitions. Other leading Bascologists are also getting old. The work is much better done that the part which appeared in the Revue de Linguistique –
 (note 1)Il faut écrire par le retour du courrier si vous voulez m’être utile.
yours faithfully
E. S. Dodgson.
12 Rue de la Sorbonne,
Paris. 13 Février 1893.
