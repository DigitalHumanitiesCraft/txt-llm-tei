9 Oct: 1983.
Dear Dr Schuchardt
are you dead, ill, or in a bad temper with me? I should much regret an affirmative answer to any of these questions – But you have not sent me a single line since I left San Sebastian. I have just received a postcard from Van Eys, who offers to revise my proofs for the new edition of Capanaga, which I am printing here at my own cost: 500 copies, which will be sold at one franc each. The printer insists on being paid for each set of 16 pages, and the total cost is 250 francs. I have done so for the first two of which the first was finally struck off on the fifth of this month the printer contriving to put in a few slight errors which were not in the proofs. Since the 1st, I am at the hôtel Cadete-pension for a month at 650 reis a day. I coud not work under Figueirinhas, and did not like him. He knows hardly any French or English, yet wished to 
share my classes! This system is ridiculous of course. I do not lose much financially, but he accepts my offer to return 150 francs out of the 200 paid to me for the journey and so I am in a financial difficulty as serious as ever – my Capanaga will cost me 250 francs, a sacrifice to science. Can you lend me anything? No 76. d. in 
Vinson is not a very faithful reproduction of the original of which I have an incomplete copy. A binder here has spoilt a book omitted by Vinson - 
R.S.V.P.
E. S. Dodgson. 
Vizeu.

 (note 1) This is a very gloomy and rainy town.
