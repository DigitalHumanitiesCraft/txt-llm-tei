Dear Sir
I received from Biarritz today the 1st part of your 
Romano-Baskisches - I hope you intend to go on with it - I had read most of it at 
Sare thanks to MrWebster but shall be interested in looking through it again. I send you a small brochure of your own. I wish you would publish a critical edition of Gueroco Guero with translation to aid beginners - What we want is a Concordance Dictionary to all known or possible parts of the auxiliary verbs in alphabetical order giving instances of their use in a sentence, stating their meaning, dialect, and precise place in the verbal system. These verbal forms are really the only real difficulty and one wants a handy guide to define them all. Can Latin tussis come from Basque tua, opes from opa, Cucullus from Kukul-du to hide or cover? and might not the l of cuculus, and of ille the pronoun, be connected with Basque ille of the agent as in eguille? I suppose Greekὀιειν = solere must be connected with oi in Basque with the same meaning. anca = leg reminds one of English ankle, and zango of shank and çilar of silver and silber - I suppose the “crastes” of the Girondine Landes come from Keltic kraza = dessecher, and that Boulou (Pyr. Or:) and Bourboule (Puy de Dome) are from Keltic boul or poul a well, source, fountain, their characteristics being their famous eaux thermales - the 2nd name is reduplicate r standing for l -
yours

with best thanks
