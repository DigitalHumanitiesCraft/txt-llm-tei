Dear Dr. Farinelli, 
I received today a copy of your new book "Guillaume de Humboldt et L'Espagne". You asked me to judge it with kindness. I have not had time yet to read it all through, but I must tell you that I think it very far from kindness on your part to quote the impostors Webster and Vinson and to say nothing about me. You wrote to me for information on the subject. I gave you all I coud, namely the name and address of J. M. de Bernaola whom you would not otherwise have heard of. Yet you give me no credit at all. I was however prepared for this, as you published a note which I gave you verbally about the custom of keeping archives in Spanish in Sardinia without any mention of your informant. I know a good deal more about Basque and the Basques than Webster, Vinson and Schuchardt. You mention them and you ignore me! They have not behaved like gentlemen towards me. You need not ask me for any more information. Your calling me in your dedication "caro et ottimo amico" is a deception.
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson.
