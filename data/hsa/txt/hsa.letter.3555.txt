Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
best thanks for your card & the letter of the Secretary of your Academy, rather too flattering for me, which came in a registered letter this morning. After taking the unnecessary precaution of registering it, you might ]I[ think [I] have put more than a dozen words of your own it [sic] it, as they are never wasted on me. I sent back to Madrid this morning the last set of proofs, rather the proofs for the last section, of my inscriptions. They will appear in March, I believe. The work embraces 115 localities; and I have myself visited almost everyone of them which lies within the Basque region. It will consist of about 80 pages. It costs me at least 100 pesetas for the separatabdruck, which I shall therefore have to sell as far as possible. Judging from my experience of Capanaga I shall have few purchasers indeed. I sold 10 of the last Leiçarraga dictionary, and gave away all the rest but my own copy. I have not visited all the Basque villages yet; but probably among the unknown ones I should find no inscriptions other than sepulcral. Webster sent me his bit of D'Urtes Dictionary, with many misprints. I hope the rest will follow. As Vinson does not seem disposed to mark as mine all items in my 4th supplement (which I offered to let him embody in his, which is to appear soon) which he would otherwise have overlooked, it is possible that I shall not send it to him. I forwarded to him yesterday the Belloc Leiçarraga. 
 (note 1)Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson, 
Hotel Central, Biarritz.
