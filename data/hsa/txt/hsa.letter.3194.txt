Dear Dr Schuchardt,
thanks for your postcard just received. How very provoking that you did not receive the 1st part of my supplement which I certainly posted at Donibane Lohizun! τις ὑμας ἐβασκανε; (note 1) what prevents your understanding St Pauls words as applied by me to Basque in Ulfilas version which I hug? Do you want Basque to become as little known as Gothic? Do you not think it is getting old? ought not King Recareds memory to be blackened by all philologists for having destroyed all the Gothic manuscripts in Spain by way of celebrating Catholic Unity? You have not discussed my Spanish Basque Etymologies for Roma and Lutetia viz ORMA and LVTESIA as defined by Novia de Salcedo. I am correcting the 2nd set of my proofs for the Concordance which 
De Charencey is printing. Arzac as yet says nothing about reprinting 
Capanaga – he ought to be whipped. Van Eys wonders why I give my time to 
Basque. I saw 
Larrieu today but he gave no definite answer about the Imitation. I send you Mr Thomas’ tirage à part with his autograph in red ink on the cover.
Yours in haste
E. S. Dodgson.

Paris 7 Fév: 1893.
