Hôtel Central, Biarritz. 15 May 1896.
Dear Dr. Schuchardt 
I got your postcard this morning, and conclude that my last must have crossed it. If you had asked me about two months ago, I coud have sent a copy of the last bit of my B. V. F. & D. to Prof: 
Giacomino. But I sent it to the Public Library at Orthez, and the Mayor while thanking me wrote that there was no one there interested in Basque and the Public had no entrance to the Municipal library, contradicting thus what I had heard from others. I am however writing to De Charencey to ask that the Actes of his Society may be sent. I did think myself of sending the book to Giacomino when it came out, but was not quite sure of his address. I dont think I have seen any of his own publications. I am sending him a copy of my appendix to Van Eys new book. The latter Bascophile (who seems to be very unfriendly towards me, perhaps through jealousy, or the famous stupidity which Mr. A. D'Abbadie attributes to him, or the vanity which Webster does) thinks this appendix useless, and refuses to buy any copies. His publisher has not answered my letter offering to sell him some. I paid the printer 25 francs for it on the 1st of May, and your copy was the first sent off. I ask 35 centimes post free for the leaflet. But you owe me nothing "save to love one another", as St. Paul says. I think I have told you that in Dec: 1894 or Jan: 1895, I called the attention of Van Eys, Vinson, & the Editor of The Academy to Larramendis mention of these very proverbs. But he ignored my information, and makes a fool of himself in the Avant Propos in consequence. What happens often will probably happen soon. Hence the two meanings of sarri in Basque. A Basquaise said to me the other day "nous arriverons souvent", or something like that, when it was clear she meant bientôt. Harriets Dictionary is the only one that defines the common word saldare = avoine. He derives it from zaldi-ale = horse-grain.
Yours
E. S. Dodgson.
