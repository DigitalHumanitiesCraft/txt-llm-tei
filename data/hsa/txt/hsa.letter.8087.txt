Panjab Notes and Queries
 EDITOR’S OFFICE
 AMBÁLÁ, PANJÁB, INDIA Dated 19-9-1884 
Dear Sir,
Thus after 25th Aug. I am really at Simla in the hills (note 1) for a month trying to recover from an attack of optic neuralgia brought on by overwork, which as you may imagine, is a chronic complaint with me!
You are quite welcome to keep my M.S.S. &amp; use them at your leisure &amp; pray do not work at them too soon after your illness in order to send them back to me  soon. I am in no hurry to get them back again. I am glad to think you will find them of use.
You will see that we make cites of corrupt English etc in my paper from time to time &amp; I hope you will find them useful.
I see the 1st volume of my Legends of the Panjab (note 2) is highly spoken of in England &amp; France which is gratifying but I wish it sold better, at present I am a much heavier loser over the sale than I can afford. I have  commenced vol II but unless the sale increases a good deal I shall have to stop the other volumes which will be a disappointment as the material is all new.
I am editing the late Dr Fallon‘s Hindustani Proverbs (12,500) for his executers. One part is out. (note 3)
The Notes &amp; Queries is getting on very well indeed, I am glad to say, I am doubling the size of it next month.
The notices are out that Mr Fleet, (note 4) the Epigraphist, &amp; myself are to edit the Indian Antiquary from next January. (note 5) I hope it will be as successful in the hands as in those of Dr Burgess
Yours truly
RTemple
