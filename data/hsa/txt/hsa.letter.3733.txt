Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
I got your card this afternoon, and though you discuss none of my word-relationships, yet I am always glad to hear of you and sorry to hear of your nerves continuing to worry you. I think a year in Basqueland riding, pelota-playing, walking, swimming, fishing, mountaineering, biking (as the fashion is now to call bicycling), photographing Basques and chatting with them in all their villages and hamlets, & finally the taking home a Basque bride, and a Basque valet or servant girl to wait upon you, would do you much good. You have not, I think, written about 
Etruscan yet, or called on Monsignore Liverani at Cortona. I find in St. Lukes gospel 13 forms of the feminine and 109 of the masculine thee-and-thouing. I find therein twice 
fitetz, now written fitez. This confirms my theory that baietz and ezetz are but cases of the mediative or adverbial termination as I told Azkue nearly 5 years ago when he informed me that etz meant que. In reviewing his grammar in Dubarats Etudes in 1892 I said so. What do you think? Can German uhr & latin hora be really ur Basque ura from the water clocks and ora = the shore therefore the same word. From the lands mans point of view the shore and the water begin at the same spot. Leiçarraga uses the barbarous Gallicism, lac in his Basque. The lakes near here ]here[ are called ur-haundi by the Basques. Martin Ducq, Basque author, died at Hazparren a few weeks ago. Baronne Adelsward who paid for the binding of the Leiçarraga I am touching at this moment died at Belloc-sur-Arran this morning.
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson.
