Hotel Metropole, Cork, Ireland. 17 November, 1897. 
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I have written to the Athenaeum my first letter. I hope it will appear next Friday afternoon. It is to warn you and Herr T. Linschmann against the folly of reprinting 
Leiçarraga without correcting the many, and obvious, and very disfiguring misprints. You do not say if your edition is to be a facsimile as far as type & justification go. If not, then your misprinting it wilfully has no excuse. With a facsimile should come an appendix pointing out all the blunders in the original. Can you not arrange to publish at the same time the French Calvinistic New Testament as printed between 1561 and 1566, that which Leiçarraga used? Earlier editions have a different text. Editions after 1571, if I remember right, have a different text.
