Lista, Barna. 28 Dec: 1894.
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
the lecture received from you today would have been more practical, and your advice more practisable, if you had not generalised so much. Any faults in my conduct which you like to blame you may blame, at least privately, just as I blamed you for communicating the contents of my private letters to MrWebster, and then to someone in 
Oxford, probably professor Rhys. If you blame a person, for instance, as being unchaste, you are morally bound to shew on what occasions he or she has been unchaste, or if you say ”so and so writes ungrammatically“ you must prove your accusation by saying when and where or your reproof falls to the ground as groundless. Of course if you undertake an edition of Voltoire I would gladly help you, but not financially as I am overladen with debts. Vinson has returned my copy of the book, but without saying to what edition it belongs. I have read through one other in the Bib: Nat: at Paris which differs a good deal. I think your philological telescope is wilfully dimmed & shortened. Why may not Greece and Italy have been inhabited by praehistoric Basques? & why may not these have given some words to their Aryan conquerors & successors? Why may not Κυμαι (note 1) of Aeolia near Chalkis, & in Italy near Baiae, have been the offspring of some Basque migration? Thurium too & Manduria look very Basquelike. The Decr n°. of the Etudes of Pau presents my Dechepare with one bad (note 2) misprint in the text in spite of my twice correcting the proof (note 3) & with one misprint in the note about ixutar cun, and another note out of its place. 
 (note 4)E. S. Dodgson.

I am told ausoko means neighbur in Bubi of Fernando Poo as in (note 5) Basque.
