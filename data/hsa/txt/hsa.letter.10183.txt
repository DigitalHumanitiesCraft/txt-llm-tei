Kertch, 16 September 1895,
Dear Sir,
My last letter crossed yours, so I have two of yours to answer.
Will you please send me a copy of the Literarische Centralblatt containing a notice of my sister’s Folk Tales? Mr. Quaritch, of 15 Piccadilly, is now printing for her a verse translation of „The Hermit“ by Ilia Chavchavadze, which will be ready in about six weeks. (note 1)
I cannot understand why the people of Tiflis do not reply to your letters. It is probably due to the fact  that everybody is out of town. They are not so stupid as to feel offended that you omitted the title of ,Prince‘, which has become ridiculous in the eyes of most of them.
Thanks for pointing out the blunder in my translation of Tsagareli’s catalogue. (note 2) I was obliged to read the proofs very hurriedly, and this is not the only mistake I allowed to pass uncorrected.
My good friend 
Morfill (note 3) has worked at 
Georgian, but he is so thoroughly absorbed in his Slavonic studies that he has of late neglected 
Iberian, though he still takes an interest in the language.
I had sent my translation of the first part of Dodashvili’s sketch to Conybeare (note 4), but he is at present on one of his long, erratic journeys and the Ms. was returned to me from Clermont-Ferrand,  marked „Parti sans laisser adresse“. I am therefore sending the article to Professor Friedrich Müller, and hope he will print it. The first part was published in „Moambe“ N°. 4, 1894; the second part (Moambe N°. 6 1894) consists almost entirely of paradigms etc. so I have thought it better to refer students to the original.
I have lately been engaged, with Prof. Kulakovskii, (note 5) of Kiev, in investigating a newly discovered Christian tomb (? of about the end of the Vth. century) with the XCI psalm inscribed round it in Greek uncials. Unfortunately, the conditions here are such that one has very few opportunities for archeological work.
Believe me,

Very sincerely yours

Oliver Wardrop
