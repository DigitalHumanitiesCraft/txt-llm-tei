address Post Office, Cork. 7 October, 1897. 
Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
I have had much to complain of in the treatment that I have received at the hands of other Bascophiles. I am not content with you: but still less with Van Eys and Vinson. You call the latter in La Revue de Linguistique (in the number of which for this month you will see something from my pen) Le Maitre! If you think Vinson, or anyone who knows the shakiness of his knowledge, will believe that, you deceive yourself. You have infinitely higher mental gifts than he has. You no doubt coud point out as many mistakes in his Bascological writings as I can. Mr A. d'Abbadie, Duvoisin, Prince L. L. Bonaparte did all they coud to prevent his being considered a maitre. Ask Inchauspe what he thinks of Vinsons Basque! Why then expose your insincerity? Why flatter your inferior? I now wish to ask for a definite answer to the following question. Shall I go on with my Lei√ßarragan verb Concordance or not? It has cost me an immense amount of time, but has proved a source of pleasure to me by teaching me so much that I should never have learned by any other process. I can find no hope of publishing any more of it at other peoples expense, except perhaps a bit in the R. de L. next year. I cannot afford the printers bill myself, without great sacrifice & privations. All the epistles and St Luke are finished. The Apocalypse is ready all but the French quotations. St Mark will this month be ready to the same degree. Shall I do (note 1) Matthew, John, Acts & the prefaces & supplements? 
 (note 2)Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson.
