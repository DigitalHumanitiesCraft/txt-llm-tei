Dear Profr Schuchardt
I am engaged in compiling a great dictionary of Americanisms (note 1), and intend it to include some amount of the different jargons of the country such as the Pennsylvania Dutch of my own state, Canadian & Creole French, Chinook and Gumbo (note 2). Will you in your kindness suggest any other “lingo” not included in these. I have just received Das Ausland  28 July 1884 containing an interesting amount of the Schetimasha Indians and their jargon (note 3). My American English work will be something remarkable, for I was born unto it, and familiarized myself with it from my childhood up, so that 30 years ago a friend said I was the greatest Slangist in America. I shall include a great deal of folklore negro songs &c in the book and I have now 1.100 proverbs and similes. I have written to my friend Dr  Brinton (note 4) to aid me with Anlgo-(red) Indian words.
Is there anything for which you could supply a contribution? I cant (note 5) pay very high – not more than £ 5.- but then I only expect £ 5 worth, ie a short article on the subject with as much of a vocabulary as your generosity will grant.
Our great English Slang Dictionary is progressing. It will be 6 or 7 times more copious than that of Hotten (note 6).
Do you know that an English Yiddish (note 7) is forming in London. There is a column of it every week in the Sporting Times. If you want it I will send you a specimen of it. It is English with German Jewish words somewhat changed. We shall have copious illustrations of it in our English Slang Dicty.
Hoping that you will kindly answer this as soon as convenient, and hoping that you are well I remain

Yours very truly

Charles G. Leland

Briefnummer 6369).3 Refers to Gatschet (1884, cf. Mattes 2013, Briefnummer 076-01113).4 Leland is likely referring to Daniel Garrison Brinton (1837-1899), an American physician, ethnologist, archeologist and linguist who specialized in Native American languages and culture and was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania at the time (Weeks 2002).5 Sic.6 Hotten (1859).7 During the second half of the 19th century immigration of Jews especially from Eastern Europe and Russia to Britain increased heavily. The East End of London was known to be Jewish (Kershen 2005). In these circumstances it appears unsurprising that language contact phenomena may have been apparent, although we are not aware of studies or publications on this issue. Modern Yiddish itself is a contact language, combining Hebrew and Armenic, Germanic and Slavonic elements (Katz 1987).
