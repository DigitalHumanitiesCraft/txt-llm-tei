 Prof. Hugo Schuchardt,

Dear Sir: -
Your card has just come to hand, and I am glad to know that you have been misrepresented. I shall publish it in an English translation, possibly in the next number of 
THE MONIST. (note 1)
Kind regards to yourself and Mrs.
 Schuchardt.

Very truly yours,
Paul Carus. (note 2)
