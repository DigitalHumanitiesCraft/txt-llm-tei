All Souls day 1895. á la lista, Bilbao. 
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
may I request you to do what you can to preserve the medieval frescoes in the passage of the University Buildings in Leipzig and also the Rathaus there with its Dutch gables? I have heard that they have been menaced. I love them as much as Eckerleins Keller, and in my medieval dreams they are among the pleasantest. I have been correcting proofs of my Basque Inscriptions since the beginning of July. As they are printed in Spain the delay is intelligible. I have 24 pages in type, and send to Madrid tonight enough manuscript for 24 more, and yet plus ultra. I have been correcting proofs of my new Basque Verb-Dictionary since the month of May, & sent the last back about a fortnight ago. I hope I shall soon be able to send you a copy. Azkues class has opened this season with 40 members. They tell me the number will gradually diminish. He has abandoned his dai, and pronounces da in the class. A youth from Mundaka assures me they really say there 
nai for 
naiz and ai for aiz; so perhaps he thought the 3rd person might be inferred to be dai. I send you two of the papers he circulates in class & a proofsheet. I have learnt much this summer, & been in many Basque villages never before visited by me. But you do not deserve to learn from me. I have acquired many newly published Basque books, and a few more precious old ones. (note 1) You have not kept your promise about 
Georgian. (note 2) I shall go back to Bayonne very soon & probably spend the winter at Pau & Biarritz. 
 (note 3)Yours hopefully (?)
