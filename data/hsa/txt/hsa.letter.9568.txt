My dear Professor Schuchardt;  (note 1)
 I am delighted with your “Ueber das Melaneso-Englische” which I owe to your kindness. I am sorry that I had not seen it when I compiled my Beach-la-mar (note 2), yet on the other hand I might have felt great hesitation in writing my little work at all since I now an how completely you have worked the ground. 
I am just completing a large work on the 

Rapanui speech (note 3), a vocabulary and discussion of that region of Polynesia, to which for convenience I ### the name Province of Southern Polynesia including Rapanui, Mangarovi, Paumotu, Tahiti and the Marquesas. This will be published early next year. 
As soon as it is out of hand I shall return work on my 

Samoan Dictionary which is intended to be a detailed study of the philology of the isolating languages. Simultaneously I shall edit and translate my large collection of Samoan history-myth and genealogies. 
With many thanks for the brochure

I have the honor to remain,

my dear Professor,

Yours very truly

Will
m Churchill
