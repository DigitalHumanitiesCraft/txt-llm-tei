Arrañoen Donibanen. (San Juan de) Las Aguilas, Pa de Murcia. 12 Nov: 1894.
Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
in 1888 I heard near Jaen chove for llueve. Here they say muncho for mucho. At Guadix one man at least says muinto for mucho. At Granada I heard cheno for lleno & chikijo (j French) for chiquillo. In the cloisters of the Cathedral at Toledo the boy who fetched the key for the room where the Tarasca and gigantones are kept said chave, but otherwise spoke Castillian. I think I mentioned to you at Munich this portuguese tendency in Andalucian. The chief industries of this place are fabricas de esparteria, fishing, and export of minerals. Its railway and its fine harbour with a new mole made out of one corner of the mountain on which the castles stands dominating the town like monte Orgullo in San Sebastian, its bathing shore, its palmtrees now full of fruit, its view westward along the coast as far as Cape Palo in the Pa de Almeria, its fine winter climate, make up for its architectural ugliness. There is only one building worth looking at, a recent façade in moorish style opposite the church. The streets being ashamed of themselves do not write their names in the visitors book, and all bear a family likeness – I think Valencia the safest address to give – do not call me Spencer please – only E. S. Dodgson. I am reading Farinellis article on Benedetto Croce which he gave me in Madrid On page 8 he quotes “Jacobus” (as the Compostela manuscript tells its reader it is to be called) but makes it speak of Spaniards instead of Basques. I am told that the mountaineers of La Sierra Nevada rather bark than speak. Prof.r F. J. Simonet gave me his new book Influencia del elemento indigena en la cultura de los Moros de Granada. He shewed me (note 1) a maltese book which you should ask him to send you.
