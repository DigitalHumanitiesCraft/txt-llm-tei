Dear Prof. Schuchardt,
I am sorry that you will not be in Gratz during this month, as I expect to be there soon. I shall leave this place on the 15th of this month, go to Munich, Salzburg, Gratz and Vienna. If you can send me a line to anybody in the town who will talk with me half an hour and tell me what to see or what one may go to see in the country round I would be much obliged, but dont (note 1) take the pains to do this, unless you really happen to know somebody there who can do this. It is only a chance anyway, as we may change our route -  There is a lot of trouble in London with our Dictionaries (note 2), as the publisher, a young German, was lately drowned. I expect to go on to Budapest. I am very sorry to think you will not be in Gratz.
Yours truly
Charles G. Leland
Prof. Hugo Schuchardt
