Mon cher Mr le Dr Schuchardt,
vous ne me donnez pas le rang de Bascologue mais seulement de Bascophile! My Bascologizing in which I am like a pelican in the wilderness all alone sometimes fills my head with strange fancies - I now derive Horatius from hora a dog with the termination tto or ti (eguiati = verax) & a latin case-ending. A cloud is a covering: may then Slovenian odéja = “decke” be Basque? I have seen in no Dictionary (I have not access here to Aizkibel or Larramendi) the word gortcen, gortu used in the Souletin imitation to translate “accendere” in flame (the heart) - I find in Slovenian oséba = “Person”. it means “uncle” in Basque. I have heard that priests are called “uncle” in parts of Austria, and 
Persona both in the French and English church was applied to the curé of a parish or the canon of a Cathedral. I find in Anglo Saxon aelc in Low German 
elk in old English elch = modern English each. These words remind me of Basque elkar which means “each other” “each reciprocally”. I like 
Leiçarragasbeçalacatu = “to make like unto” – almost “quasificare” or “similificare” and the S. I. yakintsutzen “to make wise”. I have returned to De Charencey the 2nd proofs of my Concordance to St John of which he is about to publish the first 3rd or half. In the preface I announce that your work, on the Basque verb is soon to appear. Priebsch is not well & is going to Oxford at the end of the month. Have you read Lancianis books on Roman archeology? For the last 5 months I have lost MrD’Abbadies friendship I hear someone has filled him with 
préventions contre moi - It vexes me very much.
