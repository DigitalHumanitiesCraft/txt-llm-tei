Dear Dr. H. Schuchardt, 
I sent off to you on the 28th of last month two copies of my new work on the Leiçarragan Verb, one for yourself and the other for the Academy of Sciences at Vienna which you adorn. Hitherto I have not heard of the arrival of the packet, though I was careful to put the address on the cover, viz "lista, Bilbao". I leave Bilbao this afternoon, and my address will be till the 20th Hotel Mendia, Tolosa, Guipuzcoa, after that Poste Restante, Biarritz, B. P. I notice a growing tendency among the Biscayans to pronounce z in Basque like Castillian lisped z, i. e. th English. Formerly I used to remark that in their Castilian they were wont to sound z like s. Amen seems to be the common Biscayan for here. Don J. M. de Bernaola explains it by au-en = in hoc. The Souletin heben, hebe, gives one reason to think this may be right. Eztena the sting may it be from Gothic stiggan = stinkan? I received on Saturday the Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia, for December containing the first 18 pages of my Inscriptions. It will go on in January.
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson.
