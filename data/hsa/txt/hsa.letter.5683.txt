Weender Strasse 57
Göttingen
April 22. 1871 (note 1)
Lest you should not have had my note from London I take the liberty of sending you another with my address for the semester for I have just taken rooms here. I only came here yesterday and as it was a very wet and dull day Göttingen made no cheerful impression on my mind; today everything looks brighter and I begin to think I shall be able to pass a semester here without committing suicide, as the only alternative in a place like this is between ennui and hard study: the town  appears to be in a very dilapidated state about one half of the houses apparently being ready to fall. I went to Benfey’s (note 2) this morning: the handle of the bell was gone and as I knocked trying to find a portier a female voice from the second floor shouted to me to enter and so I did. However the professor has a snug home there. I liked him very much. He advises me to read the Rigveda privatissime here: Max Müller (note 3) had strongly advised me not to begin the Veda at all. I think of doing so however. Try and get my books sent off as soon as possible: I shall be expecting the “Schein” for them at your earliest convenience for I am very miserable when I have no books especially in a strange place. Please to remember me kindly to Professor Leskien: I  will send the Welsh book as soon as I unpack my things too. I wonder if his Altbulgarisches Glossarium (note 4) is ready by this time. With kind regards
I remain

yours truly

J. Rhŷs
