Folkestone, 15 June 1897. 
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I left San Sebastian last Thursday exactly a year after my departure from Bayonne last June. I have since been at Biarritz, Bayonne, Dax, Bordeaux, Paris, and this morning once more was enraptured by the Cathedral at Amiens between two trains. I came over from Boulogne this afternoon in an hour and forty two minutes, the sea being gloriously calm. I spent 5 days in Kent in 1889; but have not since been in England, and feel more like as foraner than a native of Essex. The safest address I can give you is "to the care of the Manager of The Cheque Bank, 119 Bishopsgate street. Within, London. E. C." I have been robbed of your large brochure on (note 1) Georgian. Can you let me have another copy?
 (note 2)Yours 
E. S. Dodgson.
