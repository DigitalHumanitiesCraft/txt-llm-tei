Bechienea, Sare, Basses Pyrénées 14/1/88
Thanks for your letter. M. Mendiburu destroys all the Escualduna, but he will ask a friend who receives them, and who acts as agent to distribute them, if he has the two numbers you require. I cannot suggest anything as a present to him; unless it be a pipe or a cigarette holder (porte-cigarette) as he is a smoker.? I do not hear of anything new on the Basque. Prof. J. Campbell has sent me the "Transactions of the Celtic Society of Montreal". In it are two papers by him, one explaining the 
Eugubenic Tables (note 1) by the Basque !!! If you care to see it, I will send you the volume (w
h is not large) by post, &amp; you can return it by the same way, when read. The Congrès 
Archeologique de France will be held this year at Dax June 5. to end at Bayonne, June 12. Excursions to S.J. de Luz, Fontarabie, Irun, etc. It may produce something an the Basque. Will you come &amp; assist ?
With kind regards
 Yrs very truely
