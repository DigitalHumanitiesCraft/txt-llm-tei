Dear Sir,
MrD’Abbadie has several times complained that you did not stay long enough at his house to examine his library as he wished you to do; Today he tells me that you have not sent him your criticism of Vinsons book. I spent an hour with him last Sunday. He is very well. I have not yet received the proof of my article on Vinsons book for the Revue des Bibliothèques. I shall mention therein your “eblatération” in the Litteraturblatt. Do you think Bretongol, Welshcoll is connected with Basquegal which it translates? How do you explain “amor ematen” = to surrender? is it from “à mort” - “give oneself or ones cause to death”, or from amorem in the sense of “offer love instead of contest”. It occurred to me that Basquedario = “it flows on”, might be connected with the Persiandaria = river - I do not think it has anything to do with jarraiki, or jarrai = to follow; and that has nothing to do with iritzi or eritzi = to be disposed towards, on or gaitz, well or ill - In 
Leiçarraga the rule for this last seems to be that when on or gaitz are printed apart they are considered as the direct object; otherwhise, if I remember right, the thing or person hated or loved is the direct object and not in the dative. What is ditala with nehorc niri enoyuric for nemo mihi molestus sit in Galatians?
 (note 1) Assyrian urarte for Ararat must be Basque. & nairi too.
 (note 2) is bett related to etzan and its parts?
