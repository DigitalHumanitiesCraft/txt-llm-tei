Queen’s Coll., Oxford. Aug. 18 / 1913.
Dear Sir, 
Many thanks for your instructive article on the Meroitic (note 1). Your conclusion agrees with the archeological evidence: the sculptures before the Negro period represent the Meroites as of an Abyssinian (not Nubian) type, with thin lips, Greek noses & high pre=heads. They were non darkskinned.
Believe me to be 

Yours faithfully

A. H. Sayce.
