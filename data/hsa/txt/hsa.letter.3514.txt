Lista de Correos, Barcelona. Christmas day 1894.
Dear Dr. H. Schuchardt, 
I write to wish you a happy new year. May it lead to better things for Basque. On page 538 of your last separat-abdruck I find ahaidego & edergo – but I do not find these words in Aizkibels dictionary – When you mention Baiae and Uroneko, were you not thinking of a certain postcard that I sent you from somewhere near the Minho last autumn? Your train of thought at least reminds me of mine own, which I think I communicated to you. My address will probably be Barcelona, en lista, till the 8th Is Arabic maidah the father of Basque 
maya the table? Simonet thinks the latter comes from mensa, as I proposed out of my inner consciousness in the Euskal erria in 1888 or 89. Is my etymology of 
aps in Portuguese the right one? Apex as in St Jeromes Bible? There are a few more of my questions, I think, awaiting your answer or criticism. I have from the first, 1886 though Basque sal must be a purchase from English. We occupied French Basque land for centuries and linguistically there was then more solidarity among all the Basques as they then had more territory & less knowledge of romance.
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson.

 (note 2) more misprints in R. de L. for Oct: fancy calling Sard a patois!
 (note 3) “documents” should be, as I wrote, “inscriptions”.
