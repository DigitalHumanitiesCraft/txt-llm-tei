Hôtel Central, Biarritz. May 11, 1896.
Dear Dr. Schuchardt 
the sending lately of some numbers of The Season containing articles by myself will have shewn you that I still believe you to feel some interest in my work. Yesterday I saw in The Times that a marriage between the families of Von Göler Ravensburg and von und zu Gilsa had been celebrated on the 4th at Völkershausen, Wanfried by the Rev: W. Schuchardt. Is this clergyman a kinsman of yours? I have lately received from Dr. Carolina Michaelis her brochures entitled Zum Liederbuch des Königs Denis von Portugal (Halle 1895) and 
Randglossen zum altportugiesischen Liederbuch (Halle 1896) and a separatabdruck about the Visconde de Sanches de Baena, and a long letter in Portuguese. She and Miss Ei still practise the Basque numerals which I taught them in Vizella. When I was at Barcelona in January 1895 and the preceding month I was studying Larramendi with much attention in the University Library, and noticed the mention he makes of the book of proverbs anew discovered by MrVan Eys. The note of the latter informing me of his discovery is dated 31 Dec 1894. Just before or after I wrote to him to say what I had read, but not I think for the first time, in the great Dictionary. But as you see all in Vain. I may have written to you, as I did to Vinson and The Academy, about the same thing. My letter was not published I believe either by Vinson or the Academy. You received I hope my little appendix to Van Eys important edition. I must try and see the original at Darmstadt some day. Did I tell you of the Spanish judge who stated in reply to my question at the table d'hôte at Jaca last May that the reason why Pyrenean passes are called 
portus, puerto, port rather than porta, porte, puerta, which would seem more natural, that it was a proof that during Noahs flood ships & people sought refuge in the Pyrenees? Smoke causes shadow. In the Manuale di Letteratura Albanese del Prof. Alberto Straticò (Milano 1896) Xee = ombra, Xea = la ombra. (note 1) This is very like Basque. 
ke, kea = smoke, the (note 2) smoke, which put beside words is like kerizpe = shadow. (note 3)
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson.
