Dear Doctor
I learn from the Printer of the Revue de Linguistique that though MrVinson promised me in writing that the corrections of my Concordance to S. Peter should appear in the October number, and though I sent them in in time, he will not let them appear. There would not have been so many necessary if he had not refused to fill in and correct the work before publishing it, and the delay in pointing out the mistakes and omissions, some due to myself and some to the printer, worries me so much that I shall not again subscribe to this Revue. Vinson est un roquet. Have you seen a pamphlet called “L’Abania” by Prof: Vincenzo Dramis, Padova, 1890? It is very interesting. I found that at Salzburg and Innsbruck they call a foot, πους, “haxl” - Can this be related to Basque HATZ = vestigium, footstep? Chiesa is pronounced tchiesa as if written ciesa and not kiesa as in ordinary 
Italian, here in 
Venice - on the other hand ce is sounded ghe - this seems to explain the passage of Latin c = k into the chuintant Italian c = ch soft before e and i, and of Gothic skips or skilliggs into English ship and shilling. The Venetian ILUNA = Paturnioso, accigliato, accipligliato reminds one of latin illunis and Basque illun. Does Basque eta come from latin et or vice versâ? Morel Fatio thinks agur in Basque as in Spanish where it is sometimes avur or abur comes from augurium. I hardly think it possible since [i]t is their commonest word. No Basque books here.
