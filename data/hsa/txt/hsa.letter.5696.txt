Dear Prof. Schuchardt,
It is a long time since we have heard anything about you; but we hope you are in better health than when you left this country. We should be glad to see the rest of your account of your sojourn in Wales.
You may probably have heard that the Welsh College in Oxford has been able with a trifling aid from the University to establish a Celtic professorship there. I am a candidate for it and I am anxious to be able to present good testimonials as to my standing as a Celtic  scholar and student of comparative philology, so I hope you will excuse the liberty I have taken of asking you to write me a testimonial which I may be able to send in. You know how few the professed Celtists are to whom I could apply in such a case as this. In subscribing your name please to add your diplomas as very few of the electors are familiar with the names even of the leading ‘sprachforsher’ of the day, and please to write in German or French.
Mrs. Rhys unites with me in kind regards to you; your little friend Myfanwy talks Welsh incessantly now.
Yours truly
John Rhys
