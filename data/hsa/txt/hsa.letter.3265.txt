Dear Dr Schuchardt,
so you disdain to give your reasons for not accepting some of my recently communicated supposed discoveries of bits of Basque in various other languages! You do not answer my questions about some words in Carbonis Discur[s]os Sacros (Bologna 1880) in Sard. You cannot be jealous of me since you despise me so much. I am awaiting a fourth set of proofs for the bit of my Concordance which De Charencey is printing at Alençon. I mention your forthcoming work. I wish you would publish an etymological Basque Dictionary. I find chestatze in Salaberry, and Gèze who borrowed so much from him, but they place a T at the beginning which prevented my finding it. Have you heard from 
Larrieu? he is going to translate Ste Hélène into French: and the Basque, my English, and his French will be published by the Société Ramond at Bagnères de Bigorre. I wish Mr D'Abbadie had done and would do more during his lifetime for publishing Basque texts never printed or deserving of reprints e.g. 17th and 18th century books of which only 1 copy or two are known. The Librarian at Madrid tells me that the Atsotizen Urrhenquina there has Koeinta in the proverb 519 so it is an e with the bar broken in the Bib: Nat: here. Note this in your copy please - You do not explain gortzen in Souletin by saying it is goritzen, which I think I knew, in Labourdin – I suppose one can get no further back. I have just found a useful remedy for sleeplessness which afflicts me so much at Paris “Sulpholan” – I cannot speak of more than one nights experiment however. No news yet of the printing of Capanaga. I claim Icauna (Yonne) and Iconium as Basque names. Your health is a grief to science - Spend another summer among the Basques and dance and play pelota & swim & ride with them.
