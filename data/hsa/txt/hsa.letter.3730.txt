Hôtel Central, Biarritz, 21 May 1896.
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I have a great many questions to lay before you, but you leave most of them answerless. Do you think the asiatic princely title khan and the latin radical can-ere, can-tare (to lift the voice in song) are connected with Basque gan, 
kan? You are no ganz, and can answer if you will, quite as well as any wight alive. Do you think Greek εὑρειν and Basque 
eriden>may be connected? or Greek 
ἥρωs and ἔρωs with Basque erho, mad? or is this too bad an error to be spoken off? I thought many years ago the Pelagi and the other megalithic builders must have had something of the Basque in them. If can is rightly printed in Van Eys proverbs it may be that canal and Basque zan, zañ, 
zain, are all related, like 
bekala and bezala, like lako and laço, unless this laso is another of the misprints in the proverbs of 1596. Between Greek σίγμα and Basquesugea the connection seems obvious though the latter may well be from su = fire and gea = without, the heatless or cold-blooded snake that hisses and wriggles like an s. It may be I shall go to London in July. Did you see the Leiçarraga in Rome? My aunt the countess Pierantoni lives in the Corso V. Emmanuele, no 51.
Yours
E. S. Dodgson.
