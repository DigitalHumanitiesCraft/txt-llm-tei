Seville, Oct: 19, 1894.
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I am still with my German friend picked up on the 2nd of this month. He insists on talking Biscayan Spanish rather than German. He is a very good fellow with no pretentions to learning. My address till the end of the month will be Poste Restante, Gibraltar, Espagne. Do not call me Edward Spencer anymore but only use my initials. I shall not consult Jose Leite de Vasconcellos anymore. My veracity and my ears are as trustworthy as his even in the department of the ugly Portuguese dialects. A man who says that history has had no effect upon the formation of languages must be a fool. How do you explain the conjugation of 
etzan if it was not once itself betzan? How do you explain niscarros a folkword meaning mushrooms & toadstools in Tras-os-Montes? I must say that I do not bow to your explanation of ca! by carajo. to begin with the accent in the latter word is on the 2nd syllable. The Catalans are the chief users of ca! but they I think only shorten the other word into caráy: Bargo in Basque may be Keltic I think or Kelto-Iberian. I finish Erros many errors tonight. Keep my article a little longer yet please. Dr. G. Gröber has not answered my note. Thanks for friendly attempt on my behalf.
E. S. Dodgson.
