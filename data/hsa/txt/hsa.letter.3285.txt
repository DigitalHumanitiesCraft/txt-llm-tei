12 Rue de la Sorbonne, Paris. Queen Victorias birthday 1893.
Dear Dr H. Schuchardt, 
I have to thank you for your work entitled „Der Mehrzielige Frage und Relativsatz“. In return I have sent the 3 gospels in Ainu for your amusement. The other, St Matthew, is printed all out of order. A new edition of the grammar & Dictionary by the same author is being printed. I despatched on Friday last, the day of publication, the final part of my brochure called on the outside The Basque Verb Found and Defined, VIII & 36 pages. Say all you can against it. I have not yet read all of your article on Loth, nor all of the latters book – his note on coxa, page 42, seems to me very feeble. If coxa was both a Brythonic and a Latin word, how can it be said that it was capable of different treatment as Brythonic or Latin, since the Brythonic and the Latin treated it in the same way? A Moriori or a Yahgan considers that an Englishman and a German treat the Gothic hus in the same manner, and would be surprised at haus or house being differently treated in the future by the one race or the other. I have dedicated to you my Concordance to Philemon, as published by the Société Ramond. I have not yet got the tirage à part. Inchauspe declined the dedication at the last moment, because he would not believe that I coud quote Calvins French Bible without having a religious respect for it, which I expressly disclaimed, while saying that I respected the Bible even when badly translated. In Euskara 13, which I only received on Saturday, though it bears the false date of März 15, thus being even more deceitful than the two preceding numbers, as I have pointed out to MrLinschmann, you must insert aditu between aldiz and dut in the 2nd line of my shepherds professorial letter. This word was in its place in the proofs, I feel sure; but probably Hannemann, whose emeak instead of emea shows how little he knows Basque, changed it through ignorance. Is it not nicely written? Uhlenbeck seems to be a great gain to our society. Some of the words discussed by him, as well as elkar in Van Eys letter against Schwerdfeger, have long since had my attention, as you partly know from my correspondence, as I think Van Eys does also. I should like one day to draw up a catalogue of the unconfessed faulty translations etc: in the latters Dictionary. Azkue has sent me 5 or 6 brochures on basque by Arana, (not father J. I.) of Abando – they have some glimmerings of science. I have sent to Linschmann a list of the 95 mistakes in the 95 pages of Vinsons copy of the Petites Oeuvres de Pouvreau. Can you give me your book on Keltic? My debts will not permit me to buy it at present.
E. S. Dodgson.
