6. Nov. 1893. Capanaga uses deitu with the dative often = to name, to call.
Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
in the first 85 pages of Capanaga I have registered exactly 300 forms of the verb, many of them only occuring once. I expect the remaining 70 pages will yield at least a century more. I desire by return of post, if you please, your opinion on the following question. On page 20 one finds ni beccatariau confesseetan nachacho Iaungoico guztiz poderosoari Andrane Maria veti virgineari, Jandone Michael arcangeleari, Jaundone Batisteari, Aprostu santuay etc: santu guztiay and on p. 42 Bay, baea Iaungoicoari esqueetan nachaco. Is 
nachacho the form with the plural dative = to them, as one would infer from 
santuay and guztiay? or is it a misprint for nachaco? in which case the singular would be taken distributively as often in Leiçarraga, the expression being mentally repeated before each dative, and turned into a plural before santuay and guztiay? nachacho does not seem to appear in Zabalas grammar, nor in that of him who sees his language askew. Tell me your opinion about Esthonian 
né> and Basque ne|ska, 
ne|ska-to, ne|ska-tcha; and why you reject my suggestions about leilão, and its connection with lelo-tama in Esthonian, lelo in Basque, lallare in Latin and perhaps λαλειν in Greek, and all the words derived therefrom. I have heard nothing about Euskara 14, in which I hope they will publish the list of 
Armenian words which I claim as Basque.
