Hôtel Central, Biarritz. B. P. Frankreich 12 February, 1896.
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I am always glad to read your elegant German even when I do not quite agree with you. I will try to find out what is become of the Georgian monks expelled from Montauban in 1880 or 81 & let you know. Websters edition of D'Urte does not appear to be commercially obtainable: so on Vinsons advice I have written to ask for a copy from Webster himself, as I feel it my duty to risk martyrdom for the sake of Basque. Vinson has informed me that he is preparing a supplement to his Bibliography, and that he will accept contributions from me. I shall therefore postpone the publication of the 4th part of mine own, send him what I can, and see how much of it he gives me credit for. The monks of Belloc-sur-Arran here lent me their copy of Leiçarraga; and I am extracting as fast as I can the verb of St. Lukes gospel. When that is done, I have to send it on to Vinson to be described in the Bibliography. Do not Urtchu (a river) and Iza (a tour on the red river (ibaigorri)) near Tonkin look like Basque names in Eastern Asia? Who can tell us whence the Basques and their language come? with whom they have been in contact? Let me recommend you to subscribe to The Gaelic Journal, 57 Dane Street, Dublin, 6 shillings a year. Have you seen Bains new Dictionary of the Scottish Gaelic? I would that Roentgens aktinography may lead us to look through the dark centuries and shew us the roots and sproutings of unseen Basque!
E. S. Dodgson.
