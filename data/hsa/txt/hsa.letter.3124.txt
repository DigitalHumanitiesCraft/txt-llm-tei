Paris, 10 Déc: 1892.
My dear Dr. Schuchardt,
here is your Schwerdfegerian again - I know you like to have something to scour and something to scour at. I have lately seen something of Theodor Reitterer, a Viennese student, and a friend of 
Priebsch who was with him in England - I am continuing to take Esthonian lessons. I know that asta means year therein, it suggests basqueaste week - Also Lelo meaning song or refrain as in Oihenart or Inchauspe is the same in Esthonian. - Also the noun accompanied with numerals is not in the plural - the number seitse translates and is something like zazpi. I have begun to translate La Vie de Saint Alexis, as printed by Profr. Gaston Paris, into Labourdin. I am about to send off to Arzac my copy of Capanagas Catechism. Though he promised to print it  in the next volume of the Euskalerria I should not wonder if he burnt it like my Balearic newspapers, as another “papel inutil”, with his “franqueza Cristiana”! Vinson is churl enough to refuse to let me finish copying into my exemplar what is wanting in the 2nd part, because I told him that I thought he ought to return to Lopez, who has several times asked for it, the copy which he borrowed from that publisher. He has not yet given me his edition of the O. M. de Pouvreau but I read it by 
Ademas kindness. The Comte de Charencey promises that I shall soon have the proofs of my Concordance to the verb in the Epistles of St. Jean Leiçarragaren araura - that consoles me in making my asses  bridge as Van Eys calls it. I hope that it may help those who are not Asses to mount more easily the ladder leading to the word of God - zubi = zurbi how many bridges still in basque land have only two bits of wood to boast of! and a ladder is but a bridge for mounting with. I find in Pečniks Praktisches Lehrbuch der Slovenischen Sprache (a dateless book) that baita means hütte. I think this as well as your Italian word may have something to do with 
Basquebaitan = “chez”. I have long thought that Slavonic gora = Berg might have something to do with Basque meaning “height”, “en haut”. I am expecting to correct next week my final proofs for my second article on Vinsons Bibliography - it will appear in the Revue des Bibliothèques for December, and you shall have a copy, if you tell me that you had the first part, and desire this. MrWebster in his brochure on the inscriptions does not quote rightly those at St Jean de Luz or Baigorry, so like each other in sense, or translate properly the latter - I sent Arzac a copy of what Marineo Siculo gives us of Biscaian but have not heard or seen if he has printed it in the Euskalerria. Basqueahur, creux de la main, looks very like Armenianagur which it translates - I have been at 12 Rue de la Sorbonne since the 12th of November, so I think my stability deserves an answer from you. The Souletin imitation has ekhoiliar (note 1) for beatus (in speaking of the saints in heaven.) Can this be from coelicola?
Now good night and pray  (note 2) for this martyr to the fascination of the Basque nation. Soy muy inclinado á vencer lo impossible in the words of Calderon (La Vida es Sueño.)
E. S. Dodgson.
