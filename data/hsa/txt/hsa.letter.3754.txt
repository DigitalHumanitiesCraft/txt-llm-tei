Windsor, 28 June 1897. 
Dear Dr H. Schuchardt, 
I have had no letter or card or communication of any sort from you since the beginning of February. On passing through Paris this day fortnight I sent you L'Adour of Dax, containing a letter in Souletin. On reaching Folkestone on the 15th of this month I sent you a postcard. You have not, as far as I know, answered it. Why is this? I think you had better write, at least to say you mean to write no more, to the following address "Care of The Cheque Bank, 119 Bishopsgate street within, London. E. C. England". I shall be calling there personally in a few days. I am going to try to see as many Basque books as I can in London; and also to correct my edition of Micoleta by collation with the manuscript which I have never seen. If you write to MrLinschmann ask him to send the last three numbers of Euskara to Padre Julio Cejador, Colegio de Deusto, Bilbao, who has the others, and is studying Maltese and many other languages.
R. S. V. P. E. S.
Dodgson. 

 (note 1) I was robbed of your book on Leskien.
