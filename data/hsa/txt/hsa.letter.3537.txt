Dear Professor Schuchardt, 
I might say much to you about the perfidy of Arzac who has never returned some of my longer manuscripts, nor published some which he promised to publish, and that of the President of the Society Ramond who two years ago promised to publish my edition of the Pastoral of St. Hélène & any other pastoral I might offer, or any other of my Bascological works, but who, though he quite recently repeated his promise & has published it in the Bulletin of last year with the notice that the government had granted the Society 500 francs for the purpose, returned the manuscript on my arrival here without any explanation. He has not called on me, though I have been 5 times to his house without finding him at home, nor answered my notes asking for an explanation. So Bascology is a martyrdom. But there is an Irish proverb which says that one must not complain till we know whether those who hear us will sympathize, and I fear you are no friend of mine. Mr. Van Eys seems to be pleased to have made your acquaintance. I gather from MrLinschmanns last letter that Euskara 16 may be the last. Can you do nothing to keep an old friend alive? He does not grant me space to make some important additions and corrections to my already published writings in former numbers. De Charenceys society is kindly having my Concordance to the Epistles to St. Timothy printed. I have corrected two proofs already. I have not yet had the proof of my collection of Basque inscriptions which father F. Fita talked of sending me. DrE. Hübner accepted the dedication in Basque though he only knows me by letter, and modestly disclaims knowing Basque. I am not satisfied with the explanation of tarde piache given by MmeC. de Vasconcellos. She did not answer about maidah in Arabic translating Basque 
mahaina and maya. Here they say toi & choi = petit. is it Spanish chico? In a valley near here they say chec I hear. A messmate here thinks it is from 
toza. I do not agree. I am still unable to verify your (note 1) accusation about acheter. If you are right I shall make an (note 2) amende honorable.
