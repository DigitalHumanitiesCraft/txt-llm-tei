Queen’s Coll. Oxford. April 13/ 85.
Dear Sir, 
You were right in supposing that I have again been passing the winter in Egypt. I am but just returned; hence my delay in answering your letter. – I shall be very glad to be the means of introducing the results of your linguistic researches to the readers of the Academy & the English public, & I am glad to find that you were satisfied with my account of your Kreol Studies (note 1). I wish that the Editor had allowed me to write a longer & fuller notice of them.
Yours truly
A. H. Sayce.
