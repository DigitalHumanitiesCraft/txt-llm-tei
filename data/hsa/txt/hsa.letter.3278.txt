Dear Dr Schuchardt,
I received on the 29th of March 1893 10 copies of the first part of my Concordance to St Johns Epistles and immediately sent you one of them. Alas, I find two gross blunders and several others less important. These will be confessed in the concluding part of the work which will I hope be out in May. On page VII insert “sometimes” before 
change in the 4th line. On page 2 line 9 instead of Id quod préc. read “Ind: prés pl. 3e r. pl. 2e pers. n relatif” and add “aux: act” after ez. page 6 line 11 instead of imparf. s, read présent. s. n rel. It is difficult to avoid mistakes in a work of this nature. Let me have your opinion on this specimen of my labours. You will I think be glad to hear that I have already corrected the proofs of my Concordance to Philemon and my copy of the Te Deum in Souletin as printed by Ressegue]s[ bestela Merci at Pau in the last century. These opuscules will appear in a week or two in the quarterly publication of the Société Ramond at Bagnères de Bigorre, and I shall have a tirage à part I think, by which you will profit. I walked from Séez to Alençon yesterday, lunching en route at Larré, where there are some good pastures. I leave Alençon on Saturday for Mortagne. I shall pass Sunday at Chartres and reach my room at Paris on the 10th. Inchauspe revised my proofsheets but never noticed the mistakes which grieve me so deeply. Indeed my Bascological work meets with but little (note 1) encouragement.
E. S. Dodgson. 
4 April 1893.

Do not return the proofsheet as I asked.
