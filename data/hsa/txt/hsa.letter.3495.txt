Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
my address will be till at least Aug: 31, Hotel Universal, Vizella. I arrived last monday week, but have since been away for 4 nights to see Guimaraens and revisit Braga, where I walked to the top of Sameiro & to Tibaens and back in spite of the heat. The company of Profr. Joaquim de Vasconcellos and his clever wife is a great pleasure to me. They are so aimiable and communicative. I dined with them the night before last, and met a lady from Schleswig-Holstein named Ei, who speaks English well. I think Carolina Michaelis will learn Basque. She shewed me last night the seperatabdruck of your article on your Academic Basque work in which you mention me. Best thanks for doing me this honour. The leaf will remain in my possession unless you send me one. Are you not going away from Graz this summer? I should like to hear that you were learning to talk Icelandic in Iceland, or Gaelic in the northwest of Scotland. Can Arolsen in Germany come from the Basque for egg? I shall today finish reading Vinsons 93.a. I hope to reprint it. All my Basque books arrived at this inn yesterday. Priebsch is still in England I hear â€“
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson
 (note 1) Aug: 16, 1894.

 (note 2) I wish I had the Princes works on the Basque verb.
