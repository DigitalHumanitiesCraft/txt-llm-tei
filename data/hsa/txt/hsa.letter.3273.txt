Dear Sir,
on reading over your letter again I feel that perhaps I took it too seriously. I am the last to wish to quarrel with you and I desire your criticisms but I am full of worries and must ask you to be more considerate. A Roman history says that the Iberes of Spain & Colchis spoke different languages but a foraner would say the same of the Souletins and the Basques nowadays. The Romans & Greeks were not good observers of linguistic phenomena. The historian Sokrates says these two sets of Iberes were of the same race and I believe him. I left my Ms of Timothy chez Bréal and await his answer – will you accept its dedication if he accepts it? Do you want my Concordance to St John? Will you in return send me your Academic work on the verb? I told you at Munich how I wished for a pan-homo-phonic dictionary to shew how many senses the sounds made by all human throats can bear – we shall not live so long.
Farewell
