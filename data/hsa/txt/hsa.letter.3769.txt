Hôtel Metropole, Cork, Ireland. 23 November, 1897. 
To Dr Hugo Schuchardt, 
your excommunication received this morning surprises me little. I have long since seen that you are no friend of mine, though willing to use me as a cats paw or to get any advantage out of me that might be possible to you. My conscience tells me that I have tried to do my duty to the Basque language and to you in connection with it. Henceforth get your Basque books & information from others. You say that you asked me to state my grounds for thinking a facsimile edition of Leiçarraga inadmissible. Inever received any request of the sort from you. When you announced that you meant to include the misprints, which I have studied at intervals, (when in presence of the original that is, since the autumn of 1889) you did not say that the edition was to be in facsimile. If it is your intention really to produce a true 
facsimile, a quasi-photographical likeness of the original typography as a whole, I do not complain any longer. But otherwise, in the case of a book having some 30 copies of its first edition to disseminate doubt and error in the midst of its otherwise unrivalled beauty, a 2nd edition ought to be of the nature of a rectification. I think it quite possible that, in spite of your being older than I am & having a longer experience of scientific publications, I might detect more misprints than yourself and Mr. T. Linschmann. Professor Rhys thinks you very conceited. It is a word often used stupidly & has been applied to myself. For your anmassung and 
unverschämtheit I care little. For Leiçarraga I care much. I have asked 3 Irish professors to send you notes on Gaelic words used by anglers. Calm yourself & study Leiçarraga! 
E. S. Dodgson.
