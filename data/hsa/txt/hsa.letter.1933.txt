Colombo, 16 August 1891
Dear Sir,
Many thanks for the treatise on Malayan Portuguese, which I have looked through with interest. I hope you will be able to bring out a work on Ceylon Portuguese. I shall be glad to help you as far as I can. There have been no recent works published.
Yours truly

Donald Ferguson
