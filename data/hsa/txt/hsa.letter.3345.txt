Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
I shall leave San Sebastian on Monday and arrive at Collegio do Senhor da Boa Fortuna, Vizeu, Beira Alta, Portugal, on the 12th of September. You had better address your publications thither. I expect to pass the 10th at Salamanca, and shall call for letters there. I sent off my case of books from here this morning to the Douane at Villar Formoso. They make it weigh here 90 kilos, though at Paris at Hendaye and at Irun they labelled it 90. I dont think any books have been abstracted, though, perhaps owing to the shaking in the train, a certain space has been formed at the top layer. In the hymn to St Ignatio in La Union Vascongada no 708 what is errepiretan? A waiter here says it is romeria but another person says that this word is 
erretireta – perhaps from 
retraite. Kgeinuz I take to be for keignuz = keiñuz = beckoning. I still repeat that I believed deitzen and 
deritzen to be the same word, but quite distinct from eritzen, though some of the forms of the two verbs coincide, as is the case in other languages. I thought that you had muddled them up. I feel insulted, I must say, when on saying to a Basque peasant agur he replies adios, or if I say gabon and he replies 
igualmente: but there is no doubt that Basque is in its death-throes. I think I have seen in print é for ere. I heard it in the mouth of a man who lives at Loyola a hamlet half way between Donostia and Astigarraga. I walked to the latter place a few days ago. They speak very good Basque there. I was surprised at some women saying to me, when I asked what tree they called astigarra, not eztakit but 
eztakin. I found something like this in St Hélène if I remember right. Can the word 
deitzen (note 1) = traire, to milk come from the word which is teat in English, or can it be related to the difficult word dairy in English? Notes and Queries of August 12th published my letter about Queen Elizabeths Ghost, with a quotation from Uriartes month of Mary in Biscayan. My money crisis is over.
