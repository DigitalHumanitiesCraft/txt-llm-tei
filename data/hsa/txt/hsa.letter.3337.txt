Dear Professor Schuchardt,
 it is pleasant to say all one can in favour of Spain, so much, and alas! so deservedly, vilified, so let this postcard, the biggest I believe in Europe and the world, speak for her! Please say something in your very important and interesting work, which I am spelling out with some difficulty, in favour of my Leiçarragan studies, if only to help me to find the means of publishing the rest. It is no mere vanity which makes me say this, but the wish to be useful to science inspite of a disgraceful and undeserved persecution which keeps me in all the sufferings of poverty, exile, etc! If you had read my manuscripts you would have known that Stempf interprets wrongly 
derrana in Dechepare. 
It means in the accusative “him or her who saith this”. Leiçarraga used darra= he says – not it is said. The servants of my lodgings here say that nola deritza medikuari can be said: that como se llama Usia? is nola deritzazu (they pronounce it deitzazu, which confirms the explanation which I gave you the other day of deitzen as a contraction of deritzen) zuk, and not zuri! that one has to say deitzat (so they pronounce deritzat) 
nikandnotniri. They do not know the expression deritzat nik, or deritzat niri either, for 
me parece. How much more I coud say if I had more money, and more confidence in your friendship. Mr l’abbé Etienne Lapeyre m’a assuré qu'on dit vous me devez (me accusatif) et non pas 
vous me devez quelquechose en Labourdin.
E. S. Dodgson.
