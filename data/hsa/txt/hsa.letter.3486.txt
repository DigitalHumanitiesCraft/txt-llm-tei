Huelva, 22 Feb: 1894.
Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
since I last wrote I have had no answer from you. I have visited Barreiro, Setúbal, Evora, Extremoz, Beja, Faro, Albufeira, Lagoa, Portimão, Monchique and its caldas, Silves, Loule, Olhão, Tavira, Villa Real de Santo Antonio, Ayamonte, thence by coach to Gibraleon and by rail to Huelva the day before yesterday. I go back in a day or two to Ospedaria da Fonte, Tavira, by Tharsis in this province and Mertola in Portugal on the Guadiana, where E. Hübner tells me that valuable antiquities have been and probably are yet to be discovered, & whence a steamer goes down the river daily to Villa Real. Marcelino Soroa says you have asked him a question which he cannot answer, and has sent me a prospectus of a new book which he is about to publish in Basque and Spanish. I have also the prospectus of a set of sermons in Biscayan in two volumes by Iturzaeta and Unzueta, to be published by Lopez at Tolosa next July for 14 pesetas. I have corrected one set of proofs for my article in the Revue des Bibliothèques and await with some fear the Vinsonian editing of my proofless article in the R. de. L. (note 1)of my remarks on Capanagas language. There are some misprints still to confess in my Capanaga.
Yours
