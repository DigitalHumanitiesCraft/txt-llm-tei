Dear Sir,
I hope to finish tomorrow my translation of S
t. Helen and, after a little more revision of the Basque text by the aid of the badly written manuscript in the Public Library here, to send it, before leaving on the 10th or 11th, for the inspection of Canon Inchauspe, who has already aided me in a few doubtful points of translation, and many more of textual establishment. I have not therefore yet had time to do more than skim your article, which will be gummed like that on Vinson into Lardizabals grammar. In Ste Hélène I note often enough the indefinite article pat for bat and still more often a t final!!! for forms of the 2nd person plural of the indicative and imperative ending in ie or u. I am about to ask for Inchauspes opinion on this phenomenon. In some cases these endings in 
zut rime with those in zu. I also note as a proof of the antiquity of the composition of the text, though the manuscripts belong to the 1st empire, the non-disappearance of r between two vowels in the interior of the verbal forms. derat and not deyat. Lasserre is about to publish a collection of Basque songs, and Adema has long been elaborating another, and Dr. Guilbeau of St Jean Lohizun talks of a collected editon of Elissamburus poems. I hope MrLlewelyn Thomas vice President of Jesus College who learnt Basque at Biarritz this summer will succeed in persuading Lord Macclesfield to publish his manuscripts, and will write about 
Basque and 
Welsh in both 
Welsh and English.
