My dear Doctor Schuchardt,
I was glad to see on Wednesday evening that you have not forgotten me, but grieved to read that your nerves are still so troublesome. Studying Vinsons Bibliographie will not calm them - it is full of misprints on every page, notably in the titles of the books and the numbering of their pages - I have sent you this evening “La Union Vasco Navarra” of Bilbao for Wednesday last containing my list of some of his omissions - they have printed it badly as they generally do in Spain - Vinson after all I told him more than two years ago says the original of Leiçarraga 1571 was of the year 1577 if not of 1616! and that Ripalda published his catechism at the age of 2 years! He is half mad - He will publish in this months Revue de Linguistique my version of part of the Helaine pastoral - I hope to do the rest when I next go to Bayonne. You will see I have been very literal and the text is correctly printed after two sets of proofs - 
De Harlez has not been able to keep his promise and publish in the Museon a bit of my “Dictionariolum topicum et analyticum Verbi Leiçarragani.” On lake Garda which I crossed in Sept: 1890 from  Turbole to Pescheria after walking all the way from Bolsano, one realizes the force of Basque urdiña = colour characteristic of water - I never saw such blue, sacrebleu! You will steam about on it a good bit I expect - You should give up tea and coffee and drink yerba maté or South American tea - strongly recommended by the medical men as good for nerves and intellectual work. Let it draw longer than Chinese tea, and put chemists charcoal in the pot, and flavour with lemon and sugar - If the Parisian latinists are right in saying that consul and similar words were anciently, say in Ciceros time, pronounced without n how do they explain the resuscitation of the n in all the modern languages in the word derived from 
consul? when in toise and mesa etc: no such resurrection of a really lost n has taken place?  I have had a good deal of correspondence with M
rVan Eys the last 6 months - He has very generously given me his big grammar and very imperfect Dictionnary besides his book, often incorrect, on Leiçarragas verb. In a day or two I shall send you 
Inchauspes “Inferno Canto I” in Souletin, and perhaps a new publication in Biscayan. 
Adema is preparing a collection of Basque songs - Vinson will soon publish 
Pouvreaus minor inedited writings - I would at once undertake his Imitatio if I were richer. I have been trying to find the means of publishing 
Capanaga, which is singularly close to Labourtin in comparison with modern Biscayan. Have you seen 
Azcues grammar? the  Etudes of Pau published at the End of January my brief critique on it. I have only seen M
rD’Abbadie once since he came to town just two months ago - he feels the weight of 4 score years very much, and is much occupied as President of the Académie des Sciences, but he often writes to me - I am going on at the Ecole des Langues Orientales with Armenian, Modern Greek and Roumanian. Not much work is done by the few students who make use of it - MrPicots new library is a beautiful chamber - Your fame is still green at Paris - A good many new Basque books have come out since we met at Munich, 4 or 5 this year even -
Now goodbye - La lingua Basca che nel lago del cuor m’è ben durata (note 1) è capace di guidarle a Paradiso - Aguian bai!
