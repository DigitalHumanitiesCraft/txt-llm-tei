Vizeu, Hotel Cadete, 12 December 1893.
Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
the whole of my edition of Capanaga consisting of 500 copies, containing 180 pages each, will be finished this night, and bear the date of the Eve of S
t Lucy, my mothers name, hers whose loss was so fatal to me in 1875! They promise to set to work binding it in its paper cover tomorrow morning, and as soon as possible you shall have two copies, one for the Academy which is printing your work on the Basque verb. I have more than once advised you to take in the Eskualduna (10 francs a year payable to Arnaud Pochelou, 5 Rue Etchegaray 5, St Jean de Luz) because it often contains undictionarized words. I feel sure that you will do so now that I tell you that it has announced in last Fridays number that it is going to reprint in its columns, the whole of Duvoisins Bible. I believe I am correct in saying that I advised this course in a letter to Pochelou, or to the Proprietor Mr. L. Echeverry who was then Deputy, or to Canon Adéma. I owe Quaritch 2 ₤s, 7s, & 6d for 11 of the Princes too costly publications. I have paid my printer here for Capanaga 52 mil reis and 900 reis, besides a few tips to his ”devils”. The binding will cost something too, and the postage also, and I shall make no profit out of the work
E. S. Dodgson. 
Agur.
