Dear Schuchardt
I have been expecting to see you this week or hear from you. I now give up the hope of seeing you before starting though I have put it off till Saturday. There is a friend of mine here whom I will ask to help you to find Trefnant should you feel inclined to go there or to find lodgings elsewhere. He lives in Rhyl: his address is W. J. Hughes 6 Elwy Street. (note 1) You have also the address of the rector of Trefnant. (note 2)
My next address will be the Bush Hotel, Carmarthen.  Mrs. Rhys will be home till Wednesday probably so if you come before then be sure to call: our address is 2 St. Asaph Street
Yours truly
John Rhys
Rhyl
