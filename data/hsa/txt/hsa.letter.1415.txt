Prof. Hugo Schuchardt,
 My dear Sir,
Your kind letter of Aug. 26th has just been received on my return from 
Canada where I have spent two months at work on the Canadian French language. Accept my best thanks. I am sorry to say that I have no more copies of my little article on the Creole (note 1) which is very imperfect compared with your exhaustive studies, nevertheless if I can find a copy of it I shall be only too glad to send it to you to help complete your collection. I cannot  thank you too much furthermore for your great kindness in recommending so warmly Prof. Pogatscher (note 2) & for sending me his little brochure on Volks Etymologie [sic]. (note 3) It is possible the position with reference to which I wrote you nearly three months ago may not be filled for some little time, but when the matter does come up I shall take great pleasure in naming the gentleman whom you so highly recommend and support him with the expression of your very valuable estimation.
I have just returned from 
Canada where I have collected an immense mass of material and shall be kept very busy during the winter working it up. As I have extended my observations North and South of the St. Lawrence River, I am prepared to show that the 
Canadian French is no Patois as has been supposed but is one of the most interesting phases of language I have ever examined, especially for the preservation of its old forms. I shall take a great pleasure in sending you whatever I may write on this subject. I am extremely sorry to hear that your most valuable services to science have been in any measure lessened by illness for I have long been accustomed to admire you as the leading spirit of Romance Philology and have regarded your power of work as something wonderful. Hoping that this may find you greatly improved, I am, with renewed thanks, my dear sir,
Yours most truly,
A. M. Elliott.
