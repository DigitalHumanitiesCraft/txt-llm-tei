Dear Dr. Schuchardt,
I received your card of the 17th instant today in Auxerre, whither I came on Monday from Sens by Joviniacum (Joigny) - they pronounce the name of this city Ausserre, without any k sound. Just after posting my letter at Sens it occurred to me that you had virtually acknowledged the reception of the imprimés sent from Paris, and I fear that I put a stamp of 15 instead of 25 centimes on my letter. The divisions of the dialects in Basque are all “à peu près”: as a matter of fact they are much more intercrossed and interwoven than the Dictionaries and grammars indicate, and are becoming more so daily owing to the increasing intercourse caused by the extension of roads and railways from one region of Basqueland to the other. I think I must go back thither next summer in spite of the attractions of Brittany and Holland. If I had money I would go to Lithuania, and, after walking through every village where its old language is still used, write a grammar in English of this European sanskrit. F. Fauchereau, Rue d’Egleny 10, Auxerre, Yonne, has on sale for 3 francs the Dictionary of the patois of this department (ICAUNA is not unlike a Basque word) by MrJossier. The oldest known form of Yrouerre is “yroir” (12th century); it appears also as yrour, and irour in the middle age - see Max Quantins topographical Dictionary. Please write to Inchauspe, as from his last letters I gather that he does not feel inclined to go on either with the Chanson de Roland or the Divina Commedia, though, on his promising to translate them, I gave him a good edition of both. The géographie Joanne applies the word RU from 
rivum I suppose, to many streams in this department. De Charencey also thinks of publishing an etymological Basque Dictionary soon, lets me hope that his philological society will publish part of my Concordance to the Leiçarragan verb. Mr. D’Abbadies prizegiving takes place at St Jean de Luz next summer -
address E. S. Dodgson,8 Rue de la Sorbonne, Paris,
April 20, 1892.
