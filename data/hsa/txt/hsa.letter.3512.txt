Barcelona. 21 Dec: 1894.
Dear Professor Hugo Schuchardt, 
I have to thank you for your article on Leskien received some days ago. I have not had time to read it. You have not sent me that on Vinson, which, to judge by the proof I had, is the weakest thing written by you so far as I know. I have today got your Baskisch und Germanisch. It is very interesting. But I claim to be the first Bascologist who has mentioned the probability of the connection if not between Basque landa and Germanic & neolatin words of the same meaning and sound at least of 
Baiae in South Italy being Basque, like other place-names down there, and so I think you ought to have mentioned me in dealing with these words. I have plenty of etymologies in connection with Basque which I believe to be new. When I communicate them to you, as was the case with Baiae, if not land in my Eskualduna article of 1888, you do not answer them, but you speak of them in your publications without any mention of me. I cannot find anyone to publish my writings on Basque. So I think you ought to be more generous, and at least answer such of my questions which I submit to you in my private letters. I have been up to San Juan de las Abadesas; Ripoll, & Vich (note 1), and coud say much to you about my philological observations. Professor J. [sic] Max Müller has written to say he wrote to the Clarendon Press in favour of my article on D’Urte, but fears nothing can be done. 
 (note 2)I wrote some two years ago about Land to Uhlenbeck. Have you received (note 3) the 2 Basque almanachs of Bayonne for 1895?
E. S. Dodgson.

 (note 4) Whishing you a happy Christmas.
