Hôtel Central, Biarritz. B. P. March 20, 1896.
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
thanks for your letter received today. I am sending you my Heuzkarazko Scributoak for which you owe me 2 f 70 c. I have had to give away 25 copies. If I sell all the others it will be a miracle and I shall barely regain the sum I have had to pay to Fortanet the printer, who claims still more. Try to get me other purchasers. I have sold 21 copies already, but mostly not for ready money, but to pay old debts. MrVan Eys sent me his precious edition of the proverbs. He has done well to limit it to 100 copies because he has wisely chosen to give us the misprints of the original. I am #stating Aizkibel and Novia de Salcedo by its aid. It contains some words which they have not. I hope a critical edition will follow. 
Bonari is good as confirming our theory that on is latin shorn of its beginning. Deusc occurs in Zabalas grammar p. 31. I intend to write something about the book, and it will enhance the value of my Micoleta which I think will be printed in April. I have inserted an article on my new book in The Season published here this morning I sent you a proof yesterday. The editoress is Miss Simon Rolfe a German by birth, now a French citoyenne. I have her promise, spontaneously given, to publish something more for me on Basque subjects. Oh that we had a systematic Notes and Queries for Bascologists of all nations! I try to note down my aperçus and suggestions from time to time, but often forget or lose them. I had some talk with Canon Adéma a few days ago. He has bought 6 copies of H. S. I hear my Gascon critic is J. B. Darricarrère, mentioned in 
Vinsons list of authors. Joannategi has no information about the Georgians of Montauban.
Agur!
E. S. Dodgson.
