My dear Sir,
In reply to your letter of 3rd August, I am sorry that I cannot help you much. I have tried several times to get a copy of Berrenger’s book, but never succeeded. The only copy I have seen was in Prince Lucien Bonaparte’s library. I have been as unsuccessful with regard to Fox’s book. I send you by book post a copy of Callaway’s vocabulary, and some books in the Indo-Portuguese which may be of use to you. You are welcome to keep them, and I shall be glad to have in return any book you publish on Indo-Portuguese. There do not seem to be many persons who take an interest in the language but I may mention the names of J H Eaton, Esq, Matale, and the Rev P Willenburg, Wesleyan Missionary, Colombo.
If I can assist you in any way, I shall be glad to do so.
Yours very truly,

Donald Ferguson
