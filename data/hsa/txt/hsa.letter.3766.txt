Hotel Metropole, Cork. Nov: 20, 1897. 
Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
I was very glad to get your pleasant letter this morning. Yesterday I entered on my 41st year alas! How much time I have been forced to waste! I was hoping to celebrate the day by publishing the first Basque book printed in Ireland, but have had to delay it because Oregi and Vinson have not chosen to return the proofs sent 9 days ago as Campion has. Do not speak to me about the madness of what you call the grammatical renaissance in Biscaya. Azkue and Sabino are both enemies of mine. Before realising their character I committed some of my views to them in writing or by word of mouth, and some of these appear in their works without any acknowledgement of their source! and I can detect blows aimed at me in the dark by them in return. They are not of good family, but puffed up by a superficial education & trying to float on the surface of spanish shallowness & indifference into fame. Go to Bizcaya & seek the oldest & most ignorance [sic] peasants! Go to Garai near Durango & hear the initial H still sounded! You do not say that you got my supplement to 
Larramendi, with etymologies worthy of an Oregi or a León Hiriart. I have written to the Athenaeum about the announcement it made last week that your Academy is to publish Leiçarraga. I will try to submit a few plain questions to you about Basque in Breton & Irish Gaelic.
E. S. Dodgson.
