Panjab Notes and Queries
 EDITOR’S OFFICE
 AMBÁLÁ, PANJÁB, INDIA Dated 4 May 1884 
My dear Sir, 
Yours of 14th March last, which I ought to have answered before, but the overwhelming amount of work I have to get through from day to day is my excuse.
As soon as I can find a spare moment I’ll sort my M.S.S. on the  subject of corrupt English &amp; send them you to use. I warn you that they are very bulky, and not very easy to read! I spent great labour over them 10 years ago. I do not think they are sufficiently digested for me to attempt to publish them as they stand &amp; I could not possibly undertake to rewrite them now. However if they find their way into type through your kind offices I shall be to that extent greatly indebted to you.  I have subscribed to the rescue of Mélusine (note 1) &amp; am going to use it to advertise my various notes. I send a prospectus which will interest M. Gaidoz &amp; it will interest him &amp; other folklorists to know that I have been given the Editorship of the Dict. of Proverbs in Hindustani left in M.S.S. by the late Dr Fallon, (note 2) author of the New Hindustani Dict. (note 3) There are 12,500 proverbs in the new work.
I suppose you know of Burnell &amp; Yule’s 
Discursive Glossary of Anglo-Indian terms! (note 4) But it is a book  you ought to buy.
We are all losers in India by the death of our great publisher Nicholas Trubner. (note 5)
Yours truly
R Temple
