Hotel Metropole, Cork, Ireland. 12 November 1897. 
Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
I got your postcard this morning. As I feared, it is your success in arranging for a reprint of Leiçarraga that causes you to feel less interest in my work! But would not my work be a great means of tempting people to buy and study that reprint? They cannot easily get the New Testament of Calvin as printed between 1561 and 1571, which gives the French text used by Leiçarraga. With my work beside them they can easily plunge into the heart of the mountainous regions of Basque grammar, without forming or consulting a whole library of other peoples grammars and dictionaries. I received yesterday 51 copies in tirage à part of my newest article in the R. de L. It is full of misprints for which I am not responsible. They were not in the proof sent to & by me, e. g. delaquelle for duquel. I have sent you two copies of it, and must request you to forward one of them to professor Giacomini at Milan. I have forgotten his exact name and address. The newly appointed and first lecturer on Irish at Queens College, Cork, an institution forming one of the centres of the Royal University of Ireland, Mr O. J. Bergin, B. A. seems to be likely to do some good work. Next week I shall publish here the first Basque book printed in Ireland.

E. S. Dodgson. 

 (note 1)I shall be 40 on the 19th.
