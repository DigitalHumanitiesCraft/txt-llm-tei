Dear Schuchardt,
I am ashamed not to have answered your letters sooner: there is no reason for the delay excepting my growing disinclination to writing and that I have been very busy lately getting the new edition of my Lectures  on Welsh Philology ready for the press: they are now in the printer’s hands. You will find that I have adopted nearly all your suggestions in your review in the Centralblatt, (note 1) excepting that I have left the lectures on Ogams stand without much alteration till I get a little more criticism on them. But what you admit  in them as sound is a considerable step in advance of everything that had hitherto been written on them. I think you asked questions on skulls but I have mislaid your letter and on the other hand I know nothing of skulls. A pretty good book has lately been published here by Dr. Rolleston and Canon Greenwell on “British Barrows” (Oxford 1877), (note 2) which may incidentally help you  I am sorry to say that we have not yet any photographs or else I should be most happy to enclose them. Mrs. Rhys unites with me in kind regards to you.
Yours very truly
John Rhys
