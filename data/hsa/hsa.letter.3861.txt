Balto Mar 9, 1883.
Dear Sir,
According to my word sent you on leaving New Orleans I have today seen Dr. Basil L. Gildersleeve of the Johns Hopkins Univ’y of this city (Baltimore) editor of the American Journal of Philology (note 1) and he has kindly consented to send to you in my name the number of that publication containing the article (note 2) to which I referred in my letter from New Orleans. It gives me great pleasure to do even so slight a thing for you as to procure this article. The titles of my works in America are “Old Creole Days”, “The Grandissimes”, and “Madame Delphine” (note 3) but I assure you their rendering of Creole dialect is not of nearly so much value as that given in the magazine which goes to you today  Have you Thomas’s grammar of the Creole language, published in Trinidad (note 4)? It would be invaluable to your purposes.
With great respect, I am yours truly,
G.W. Cable
