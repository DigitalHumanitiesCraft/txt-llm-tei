Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
I am hoping to start for Heuscalherria on the 21st en route for Portugal. Please write and tell me how you are, and if you desire me to get any special information for you. They have given me my diplôme for Greek and Roumanian, though the document itself will not I believe be given me till november – We have had a fearful emeute which spread from the quartier latin to the rest of Paris and made a terreur of 5 days, costing the government 24000 pounds: is do áibill fásas breo. Mr Linschmann tells me that he never received my list of the 95 mistakes in the 95 pages of Vinsons Pouvreau 1892, though I sent it in a closed envelope paid and addressed correctly about Eastertide. I shall today finish reading the copy of the Tresor des Trois Langues which the Bibliothèque nationale possesses. It ought to be reprinted for the sake of the rare words which it contains, and the proverbs put into the dialogue, though often the grammar is faulty, a plural régime often accompanying a verb which requires one in the singular. I find that Van Eys and Uhlenbeck are much displeased with my contributions to Euskara 13, as if their own writings contained no mistakes! I have made an important discovery about Dechepare & Jean Etcheberri author of Manual Devocionezcoa, but I shall let you wait and see it in the Revue de Linguistique. Mr Thomas has sent me some proofsheets of his edition of D’Urte. He does not like Basque at all! & by his editing shews that his opinion springs from ignorance of my beloved language. 
 (note 1) I am going to Larrieus house in the contry tonight to spend Sunday.
