Panjab Notes &amp; Queries
 EDITORS‘ OFFICE Dated 20-11 1885
 [Hs. hinzugefügt: Naval &amp; Military Club 94 Picadilly London E. C.] 
Dear Sir,
very many thanks for your letter of 26 Sept. forwarded to me here. I am home on two years‘ prolong. for my health. I am sorry yours has been bad.
Your queries in the April n° 1884 (note 1) were not directly answered but they gave rise to many notes on points you are interested in on Indo-English and the various ways English &amp; the Portuguese &amp; other languages are being corrupted in India.
I don’t suppose you are likely to get anything out of „Grip“: it is only an ordinary novel written by a very flighty lady who has never enjoyed much reputation either morally or as a writer. (note 2)
I am making great efforts to convert my „Panjab Notes“ into an „Indian Notes and Queries“, which will I hope be useful to every body interested in the East. It is a great undertaking.
Yours respectfully
RC Temple
