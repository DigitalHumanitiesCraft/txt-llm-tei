Kertch, August 29. 1895.
Dear Sir,
Many thanks for your interesting letter.
I am sorry to say that it would be difficult to give you the addresses of many Georgians who take a philological interest in their language. I may, however, suggest the following (in addition to Dodashvili)
Kн. Teopиu Цepeтeни, вь. редакц.
Kн. Ubaнe Maradean, Tiflis
Kн. Turo Leiacaмuдцe,Tiflis, (Maлaя Banнкcкaя.)
Kн. Kupuллu Лopткuтпaнидзе, Кutaïs,
Улiя Ткoнiя, Kutais, (вь редaкц. Меурне)
Алексaндръ Ткoнiя,Tiflis, (редaкц. Moaкде)
Пeтръ Чмикaтини, Batum
Сuлованъ Хундадзе, Kutaïs
O. Шopданia, Tiflis
The best plan would be to send your work to the office of „Iveria“ (note 1) or „Moambe“, (note 2) or „Kvali“ (note 3) and they would distribute it for you.
K. Dodashvili (note 4) is the grandson of Solomon Dodashvili, the author of the grammar of 1830. (note 5) He understands French, German and Latin.
Mr. Arthur Leist’s address is The Commercial Bank, Batum. (note 6)
The Phshavuri Lekseki, to which reference is made in „Moambe“, were published in Tiflis in 1887, and you could get them from the Georgian Publishing Society. (note 7)
I look forward with pleasure to the receipt of your work.
After writing to you last, my translation of Dodashvili’s Grammatical Sketch was found in England. (note 8) I have asked a friend in Oxford to get it published for me, but I am afraid there is no Georgian type in England. If I cannot get it printed in my country, do you think any philological journal in Vienna would accept it?
Believe me,

Sincerely Yours

Oliver Wardrop
