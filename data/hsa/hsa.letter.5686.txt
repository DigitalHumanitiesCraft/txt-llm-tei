I have often thought of writing to you but somehow or other I have always put it off. I am very much obliged to you for your article (note 1): I read it with great avidity at the time: I want to read it again with more care soon. I have been of late engaged making a list of the Welsh words derived from Latin and writing notes on them  it will be published as a tentative list in a English periodical printed in Wales. (note 2) I will send you a copy and will be glad for corrections made by you. By the way I remember you pointing out to me the 
Welsh word palmant (note 3) as derived from a Vulgar Latin form palmentum: Would you kindly give me the reference. Also do stumulus and stupula occur any where? I have no doubt if you saw my last you would be able to give me a lot of very valuable suggestions.
With kind regards

I remain

Yours truly

J. Rhŷsv
