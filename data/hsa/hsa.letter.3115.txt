Dear Sir,
Having been asked to become a candidate for the vacant chair of comparative philology at Oxford (note 1), I venture to ask you for a testimonial, if only a few lines to say that you think I am fitted for the post by my knowledge of languages, my various linguistic work both practical & theoretical, my experience as a teacher & lecturer etc.
The professor is expected to ‘lecture & give instructions on the history & comparative  philology of different languages’ without any restriction to Indogermanic philology.
The appended list of my writings will help you to form an idea of my qualifications.
Please add your titles etc. & the names of some at least of your most important works to any testimonial you may be inclined to give me.
Yours faithfully
