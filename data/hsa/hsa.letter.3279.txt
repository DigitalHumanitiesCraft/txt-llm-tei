Dear Sir, 
I have sent you today a list of corrigenda which will serve as a rebuke to you for not having corrected the real mistakes in the proofsheet which I sent you some weeks ago. Since then I have another proofsheet which I also send as I hope you will this time be more scientifically critical & charitable. We cannot see our own blunders. Be so kind then as to send back as soon as possible at the latest by the 12th to 12 Rue de la Sorbonne Paris this new set of proofs with a rigourous correction of the slightest errors in the definitions. I shall then have real reason to respect your sincerity and to consider you a friend. I leave Alen√ßon tomorrow morning. My whole work will be out about the 1
st of May with a cover.
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson. 
 (note 1) 7 April 1893
