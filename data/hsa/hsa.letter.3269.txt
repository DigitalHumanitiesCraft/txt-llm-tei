Dear Dr Schuchardt,
parece mentira! but it is a fact (eguia bada) that one asks (escatzen du) in vain at the Bib: Nat: here for the works on the Basque verb by Prince L.L. Bonaparte published in London in 1864 & 1869! I had a letter from MrGaston Paris on Monday praising the manuscript of my Concordance to Timothy which I left at his house Rue Pomereu 3, Passy, on Sunday but declining to print it for the same absurd reason as before. You see that 
Basque does require to be popularised when savants and high intellectual institutions treat it so badly! I forgot to say in my supplement that Van Eys sent me last year a manuscript & autograph copy of the whole of the 2nd part of Capanaga. 
Vinson has refused to print it, but you will perhaps be able to find the means of publishing it. Religious people would omit some parts, just as many Basques have torn out certain pages in the first two editions of Axular. My edition of Dechepare is to go on in the Etudes at Pau. Have you seen any numbers of that periodical? I am to have 50 copies of my St. John Concordance. I shall probably sell it as my Basque bookbuying and voyages have led me into debt. The glory of printing it if there is any belongs to the generosity of De Charencey. What think you of the proof which I sent you?
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson. 
12 Rue de la Sorbonne, Paris. 8 March 1893.
