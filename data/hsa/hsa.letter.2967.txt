My dear Sir,
I have heard from Dr.. Bower of Madras in reply to my request for information about Indo-Portuguese He says the use of the language has nearly disappeared in 
Madras. He sends the only book he could obtain, which I have the pleasure of sending you herewith.
Yrs sincerely,
R. Caldwell, Bishop.
