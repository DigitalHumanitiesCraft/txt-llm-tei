St. Germains, Oxford
Dec. 23. 1879
Dear Schuchardt,
You are greatly mistaken there is nothing to account for your not having heard more from me excepting the fact (for such I fear it is) that I am ever a bad Correspondent. We were greatly pleased with the Keltische Briefen (note 1) and I think I told you so: if not I meant to have done so. We also last
Rhys (note 2)
last spring or summer saw that you were making a sojourn in the south of Spain: I felt I envied you very much, though it is not Spain I want to visit so much as France and Italy. I should have replied to your last letter sooner but we have been in some trouble about little 
Myfanwy as she has been ill but she is  now getting better. I am sorry to say we have no photo of hers or else I should have been glad to send it you: in lieu thereof I venture to send you one of my own taken at Carnarvon last summer. 
Myfanwy has no brother but she has a little sister whose name is Olwen: she is now three years and a half old.
I do not know much about 
Trübner’s arrangements and I am inclined to believe that Zupitza (note 3) had no copy of the second edition sent him: in fact I think he gave very few copies away for review this time either here or abroad. If he had done otherwise I have no doubt you would have had one.
Mrs. Rhys unites with me in wishing you a merry Xmas and a happy new year
Believe me

Yours very truly 

John
