Dear Professor Schuchardt, 
I asked Mr. Charles Verel to send you his Alençonnais grammar. I hope you have received it ere this. I find your 
lettres Celtiques most charming reading. I was wrong I think in supposing that I had already read them. As for the Basque in your “Der Mehrzielige etc” 1893 (of which I hope you will send copies to the Ecole des Langues Orientales and to MrEmile Picot (another Pico della Mirandola)) may it not be that nor in the two sentences beginning nor nola mintzo and in the quotation from Tartas is but the contracted form of nehor, nehork which in Leiçarraga means “tel ou tel”, “aucun”, “quelqu’un”, “on”,? Comme quelqu’un parle au dehors de la même façon parle-t-il au dedans. Quelle récompense plus grande peut on désirer au monde? Io III nork zer erranen du? was wird man sagen. que dira-t-on? I understand from De Charencey that the committee of his society would be more likely to publish Capanaga in their next volume if they had more Bascophiles among the subscribers. He does not of course put it exactly in this way and repudiates any offers of subscriptions with conditions attached: But I have no doubt that the affair would be more speedily settled if you for instance and Van Eys to whom he has written by my advice were to send your ten francs and express an earnest wish to see Capanaga in print at the earliest possible date. You would get a volume of some 300 pages full of linguistic matter in return. Mr Iago of Plymouth announces that new editions of his English cornish Dictionary (the companion to Williams) and of his glossary of the Cornish dialect of English are being prepared. Please write soon.
E. S. Dodgson.

 (note 2) Is Uhlenbeck right in saying that ardo means drink in general? I trow not!
 (note 3)Azkue is not inclined to admit he is wrong.
