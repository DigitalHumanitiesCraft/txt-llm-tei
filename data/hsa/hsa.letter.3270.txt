Dear Dr. Schuchardt,
Professor Gaston Paris returned to me this evening at his class my rejected manuscript, recommending me to offer it to the Philological Society, to which Professor Michel Bréal belongs, and saying that he agreed with my views as expressed in my letters on the subject. So now it shall be offered to 
Bréal, and if they take it I hope you will accept the dedication, on the condition that, if you do, you will not suddenly break off relations with me, without assigning any reason, as Mr A. D'Abbadie has done. You see he mentions me in a letter in the report of the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language which I received yesterday – In revenge I voted today for him as for you Rhys, Roehrig, & De Jubainville as members of the council. Why à priori am I so foolish for expecting to find bits of 
Basque in many other languages? We know so few languages for any length of time in writing, and so little of former wanderings and intercourse of tribes – Even now history only records a hundredth part of what passes in the world. Ei in Esthonian meaning not reminds me of Basque e, ez, et. I have for several years thought of pindarra “the spark” as an etymon for Pindaros the poet. That will strike out sparks of wrath, and I shall again be accused of persecution. I had a letter from Priebsch today. He says you have given him some work, & sends me a photo of my old college at Oxford, new for 500 years already, Uriconium the old latin name of Shrewsbury suits its position on a hill jutting out into the river sabrina: 
ur-ika-oiñ, foot of river-hill.
10 March 1893.
