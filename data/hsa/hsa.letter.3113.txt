Dear Sir,
I am much obliged to you for your letter last month.
You confirm my idea that German scholars are sceptical about Aryo-Finnic affinities. But Winkler (note 1) has shown such a want of judgment in his views of the relationship between the Ugrian & the Altaic languages that I do not feel much confidence in him, in spite of his learning. It seems to me that the question lies in a nutshell: how are we to explain the identity of Aryan & Finnic verb-endings? (note 2); is the development of vowel-harmony in Accadian (Sumerian) & Ugro-Altaic enough to establish common origin? If not, then I do not see any more reason for connectg Ugrian with Alatic than with Aryan: the numerals are distinct, & there is but little  superficial resemblance in inflections & vocabulary.
Susian (note 3) is, of course, quite distinct from Sumerian & from Altaic & Ugrian. I wish I could persuade you to re-consider the arguments I have adduced – to consider not so much the difficulties of accepting the views I have stated, but rather the difficulties of rejecting them. I wish I could read the article by Budenz (note 4) which you mention; but altho I read Finnish easily, I have no practical knowledge of Hungarian. But I must learn it soon, if I can find a suitable book to begin with. 
I am glad to know that you are working at the affinities of Bask. Its grammatical structure has always looked to me like a development of the ‘incorporating’ tendencies of Sumerian, & quite distinct from that of Hamitic & Semitic, however much its vocabulary may owe to Hamitic.
The European languages are probably much mixed both morphologically & lexically. I am inclined to conjecture that the  grammatical gender of the Aryan languages & and the use of plural inflection in Aryan (& Finnish) may be due to Hamitic – or even Semitic (?) – influence; the connecn between feminine gender & plurality is remarkable both in Aryan & Semitic.
I agree with you in thinking that the principles on which we assume or reject linguistic affinity require discussion; & this is one of the reasons why I have, after some hesitation, given a chapter on Aryan affinities in my book. The science of language is, after all, still a very young one.
I too think it possible that all languages have a common origin.
The difficulties of race are great. As you see in my book, I have tried to get over the difficulty of the Aryan race by a new hypothesis. (note 5)
Thomsen (note 6) makes out Etruscan to be a Caucasian language (note 7); but the Etruscans were ‘pingues et obesi’, (note 8) which looks like a Tartan race. 
Lacouperie (note 9) connects Chinese with Sumerian,  but he not only derives their civilization from Susiania, but also tells us that the Chinese were originally fair & blue-eyed, which is quite against affinity with the Mongolic Sumerian; while if we assume that they spoken Susian, this would harmonize with the affiliation of Susian to the languages of the Caucasus. But, on the other hand, we have red-haired Kirgiz Tartars, & other traces of fair race in Central Asia which may be an independent development, distinct from the European ‘Caucasian’ race.
