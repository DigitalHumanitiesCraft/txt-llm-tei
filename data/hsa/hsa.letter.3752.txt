Lisbon, 31 March 1897. 
Dear Dr H. Schuchardt, 
I have lately been exploring some parts of Algarve that I did not see in 1894, partly in coach, mostly on foot, twice on horseback, and in a boat on the Wady Mira from Odemira to Villa Nova de Milfontes. On returning to Lisbon on Saturday I found Farinellis criticism on 
Morel-Fatios Études sur l'Espagne, a present from the author. The day before yesterday I found J. Leite de Vasconcellos busy arranging the Ethnological Museum in the Academia das Sciencias. He may be considered its founder, and deserves all praise for his work as its director. He took me to his house to see his library. Yesterday I attended his two Cornelius Nepos classes in the Lyceu. He means to go to Paris and Liège next summer. The Roman inscription which I discovered at Villaboim has been removed at my request to the Museum at Elvas, and proves to be quite new to Archeological Science. I heard the word negociastico as opposed to fantastico in the mouth of an Andaluz in the coach from the station to Aracena. My next address will be Lista, Madrid, but it is not likely that I shall be there before the eleventh of April. I leave Lisbon tomorrow after seeing the Museo Polytechnico. I noted, as before, that in Alemtejo & Algarve senhor is almost universally pronounced like Italian Signoră, muito is mūnto. I continue to be haunted by Basque etymologies which might derange your nerves if communicated. I will risk one eruption from Be-zur-bi-us or Besu-bi-us. I have paid 2180 reis today for a pair of shirt-cuff-links of silver bearing the following Irunian refrains adiskidok hesai, ora osoen lagun, (in the zoological garden here they have a wolf and an Ulm mastiff in one cage) motel orok iznai, esalea enzula. 
Lebe Wohl!
E. S. Dodgson
