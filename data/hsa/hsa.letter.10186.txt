Dear Professor Schuchardt,
Many thanks for your article entitled Khartwelische (why not Kartwelische?) Sprachwissenschaft, (note 1) which I have read with interest.
Have you seen Conybeare’s paper on the Georgian and Armenian versions of Barlaam and Josaphat? (pp. 101-141 Vol. VII N° 2. Folk Lore. June 1896). (note 2) I do not accept all my friend Conybeare’s conclusions. It is a great pity that he had not consulted E. Thaqaishvili’s (note 3) edition Sibrdzne Balavarisi (Tiflis 1895. Tuнгруc usd. m-ba). (note 4) Since my sister &amp; I completed the translation of the Lives of S. Nino, which is not yet published, (note 5) I have not done much Georgian; but a young friend from Tiflis will arrive here to-morrow and stay some weeks with me, so I shall have an opportunity of learning something from him.
My sister, with the rest of my family, has been in Georgia since the beginning of June, and will probably stay there till September, She has already obtained some valuable acquisitions for our library and has been promised several mss and old books.
It is a great misfortune that the only daily paper „Iveria“ has been suspended for eight months.
Believe me, dear Professor Schuchardt,

Sincerely yours

Oliver Wardrop
