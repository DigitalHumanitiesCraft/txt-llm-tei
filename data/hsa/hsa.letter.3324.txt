12 Rue de la Sorbonne, Paris.
Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
since my last card I have heard no more of the O Porto opening tho what the booksellers here told me seems to be bonâ fide. I have to thank you for your Lettres Celtiques. I think I have read them before. Coud it have been at Sara in 88? On page 111 of Euskara instead of Maia read Cemaia. I believe I am myself responsible for this stupid blunder. But I do not find Cemaia in any Dictionaries or Glossaries in my Basque Library, except in Uriartes Mariaren Illa, which has a useful glossary, and seems to shew in other ways that its author had read Capanaga. I hope in less than a week to have finished my Concordance to all the Epistles in the Testamentu Berria. In the meanwhile The Société Ramond not content with having printed Philemon has told me that I shall have the proofs of St. Jude also in a few days. All this is very cheering but leads to nothing but spending both money and time. I got only today the Revue de Linguistique of April 15 with an article by De Charencey called La Langue Basque et les idiomes de l’Oural, which shews how very hollow is his knowledge of Basque. I shall publish in Euskara 14 a list of his blunders together with some of those of Vinson who is to blame for not correcting De Charencey. But they might both fall into the ditch! D’Abbadie wrote to me once that there was nothing grundlich about the Count. What progress are you making with your Academie work? Arzac has not in any way acknowledged my gift of my last two brochures to the Public Library of Donostia which he keeps in disorder. He is a third rate poet and no gentle man and is prostituting the Euskalerria more and more to Erdara. The Société Ramond is desirous of publishing Se. Hélène, but would be glad to get more subscribers first, as it will be a heavy bit of printing. Are you making out the Ainu gospels which I sent? Have you read Ritchies book on the Ainus? Please let me have some more lines of your pretty (graceful) Gothic to translate. Mr C. Rudy died last week. 
Yours
E. S. Dodgson. 
5 June 1893.

 (note 1)De Charenceys Society will print Capanaga part 2 in the 1893 volume.
Paul Meyer is going to 
Oxford for his honorary D. C. L.
