Azpeitia, 31 August, 1893.
Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
I feel it useless to write a long chapter on my relations with Arzac and Webster. I have throughout sought their friendship. My conscience is tranquil. It is on their side entirely that the quarrel has been made. I left San Sebastian on Monday morning after hearing the knocker-thumps on the door of my lodging house and the deadly shots of the troops round the Hôtel de Londres which caused my landlady to say “pues el pueblo se ha levantado contra Sagasta!”. All this stupid wounding and slaughter because the bandmaster Guimon, because of Sagastas presence in the town, refused to play Gernikako arbola. Do they not know that this heavenly air calms the Basque, while the omision of it riles him more than anything? Since then I have been enriching my library & my supplement to Vinson very considerably at Tolosa, at Oñate, here in Azpeitia. Today the Jesuits let me see Aizpitartes manuscript Dictionary of 40,000 words, dated 1785. I have sent a description to the Academy. Tomorrow I go by Elgoibar to Durango, and next day to Bilbao. But address Salamanca where I shall pass the 10th. I went to Aranzazu with José Ucelaï the Oñate madman. He says they say niri diritzait Pedro = yo me llamo Pedro. & zelan medikuari diritzaio – come [sic] se llama el medico?
