Dominica. W. I. 
 10 April 1885.
My dear Sir,
I regret exceedingly the delay in keeping my promise to send you the patois proverbs/sayings. I have been endeavouring, however, to obtain as complete a series as possible, and to that end I entered into correspondence with a gentleman, here, who has a complete knowledge of our people and their language. (note 1) I will send you the paper by next mail without fail, and  I trust they will not be too late for your purpose.
I am,
Yours faithfully
H. A. Alford Nicholls

Prof. H. Schuchardt
