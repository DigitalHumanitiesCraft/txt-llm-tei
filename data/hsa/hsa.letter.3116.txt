Dear Sir,
The pleasantest part of my candidature has been the hearty way in which my friends at home & abroad have responded to my request for testimonials. (note 1) Yours has great added to this pleasure. I value it highly both as an expression of your esteem & good will towards myself, & also for its fine literary style. One feels in reading it that  with you philological learning & literary skill go hand in hand.
I am sorry I cannot help you with Rhys (note 2). I have unfortunately quarrelled with him myself. We do not speak to each other. It was foolish of him to resent the honest criticisms of so good a friend as you. He ought to know that you are incapable of petty jealousy or malice. But the Welsh are known to be an irritable race.
With best wishes for your prosperity I remain 
 Yours very truly
>Henry Sweet
