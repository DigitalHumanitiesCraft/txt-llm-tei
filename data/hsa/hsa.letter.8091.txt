Rangoon
 Burma
 26 April 1891
Dear Sir
I have to thank you for your letter of the 6th Febr last &amp; also for your pamphlet in which you have so kindly mentioned my efforts to record Anglo-Indian expressions. (note 1) I wish I could demure in that direction, but my official work is far too heavy for any-  thing of the kind just now. I am now the official President of this Great-Municipality &amp; Port &amp; all my time is occupied in seeing to its needs. 
We are in the midst here of great schemes of improvement &amp; in consequence I fear that there is no chance of my visiting Europe this year.
If you will kindly  address my MSS to
The Nash
Kempsey
Worcester
England
They will be received &amp; there taken care of.
Yours truly
RC Temple.
