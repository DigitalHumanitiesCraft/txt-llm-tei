 Dear Sir, 
I expected to write you a long letter this day but am unable to do so on a set (??) of commercial transactions. From the 16th of April – I began a few items from you, but am compelled to send some without to finished some –
I now send you seven pieces of poetry from the pens of some haytians – I had them from a friend of mine 
Mr Auguste Dupont – I will have many others, but did not as yet succeed in getting same [gem. them?] – I also send you a Catechisme in Martinique Creole language – with four pages of mine as explanations.
I remain, Dear Sir, very truly yours,
J J Audain
