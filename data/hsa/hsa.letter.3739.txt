Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
your last communication bears the Graz postmark of the 7th of June. Since then has your friendship cooled or your health suffered? In my letter in The Academy of July 18 read in the inscription QORDEAQO not GO, and a little below adentelladas. I find the name Waldo is pronounced UBALDO here. I lost on the road near Grobe, Pa de Pontevedra, my inscribed Basque makilla, as I was on my way from the iland of Logo called Toja. Malagasi ary = 
aussi reminds me of Basque are, ere. Malagasi iry is like Basque irrix = désir, the end of the latter being probably a diminutive. I think one finds iri = envie in Basque. M. vava = bouche is much like some Basque dialectal forms with the same meaning. zana = enfant is like Basque 
sein from which sehi in the sense of servant comes I suppose. I think I noticed in the Armenian Dictionaries that the words for tree and penis were the same or nearly so. That makes me think that Asturian xurra = miembro viril may be a cousin of Basque zura as used in P. D'Urte. Do you think sapi, sape! used from the Pyrenees to Portugal to send cats away may be from (zua)
zape = go down in Basque. It is true this has no directive ra to ratify such a rat-gratifying conclusion, and you will think it too erratic to be catalogued as a discovery. With reference to hobi I wrote some time ago morte cadent dentes foveis mordente cadaver. Rather ghastly! I heard bapez for bat bere ez = not at all, at Garai near Durango. I wrote the following lines on leaving Covadonga to walk to Abamia to Cangas de Oníz. Iesu nobiscum mane nutri nos vino ac pane vivamus ut hic sane usque ad aeternum mane. But I have rarely been houselled for many years past & have not lived quite sane. I slept for one night at Caminha & another at Valença on the Portuguese bank of the Minho last week. I think Minho & mine may come from Basque min = deep. Where are you veraneando? I am expecting to leave Vigo tomorrow. You may address lista, 
Lugo. I have not yet been to Corcubion.
Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson. 
10 August 1896.
