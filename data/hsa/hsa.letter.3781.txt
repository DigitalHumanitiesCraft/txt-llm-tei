23 Hostel Central, Biarritz, B. P. Frankreich. 27 December, 1901. 
Dear Dr. H. Schuchardt, 
 may the year 1902 bring to you all that you want and deserve! When I made the stupid alteration on the proof of my article on St Mark published in the Revue de Linguistique in 1899 which gave a wrong interpretation of cituán I was at Tolosa, seeing my edition of Euskeraren Berri Onac through the press, in December 1898; & the unpublished parts of my laborious synopsis of the Leiçarragan verb lay in my boxes in a lumber room at this inn. I had my doubts at the time & distinctly seemed to recollect having met with the form in St Luke. I believe my definition was correct on the proof as first set up, & that I spoilt it in an evil moment thinking of certain cases of 
du and 
baciraden also occurring in St. Mark. My work on St Luke was finished (minus the French quotations added in London in the summer of 1897) here on the 1st of June, 1896. On taking it out of my box here a few days ago upon my return from England I found, on turning to the place in question, "Cituán. Ind. imp. pl. 3e. adn: masc: aux: 20, 31. …, eta HIL cituán. …, & moururent". If you were here, you would see, from the discoloured ink & the character of the handwriting, that (except the French quotation inserted in 97) 
this article forms part of the original work written here in the spring of 96, & wasnot inserted since your criticism was published. The possibility of such a mistake as I made in Dec: 98, when absent from my MSS, demonstrates well how much we need a complete synopsis such as I (note 1)am making.
E. S. Dodgson.
