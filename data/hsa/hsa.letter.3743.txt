Hôtel de Paris, Sevilla. 20 December 1896 (note 1).
Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
you sent me a Christmas eve lecture two or three years ago. How much more reason have I to address one to you! But your conscience to mewards seems quite out of working order, and I must resign myself to counting you among my foes from the beginning of 1897, costa dediña costa dedilla, as Cardaberaz has it. The printing of my Micoleta is at the mercy of a Seville printer. You know what that means. You will have to buy it or go without. Do you think Harriet & Campion would have promised to buy it if it had no value? I think the conjunctive forms ending in a in the MS must have been meant by the author to be capped with a tilde ~ to represent an. I heard a few days ago from Vinson & 
Linschmann & have Euskara no 17.
with Xmas greetings yours
E. S. Dodgson.
