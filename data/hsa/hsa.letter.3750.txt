7 Plaza San Fernando, Sevilla. 25 January 1897.
Dear Dr Hugo Schuchardt, 
my book, printing & cover and all, was finished this afternoon. Tomorrow morning the first published copy, without binding, will leave by registered post for Mr Antoine d'Abbadie. This evening my own copy has entered the leather-binders hands. As soon as I get some paper-bound copies from the printer, whose contract included encuadernacion, I shall send you a registered packet including one for yourself, one for Mr. T. Linschmann, one for A. Farinelli, and one for your Academy, & also 2 Souletin almanachs for 1897 of which you will send one to Linschmann. Please try to make a little réclame for the book, so as to help the sale. My Basque-book-buying-and-publishing has hitherto been a dead financial loss to me, a pure sacrifice to embryonic science in the field of Languages! Messrs Georg & Co, have written at last to say they coud not obtain the consent of MrW. J. Van Eys to putting my appendix into his book. So I have still some 60 copies of it inutilisable. Is Van Eys a gentleman? I shall send him my Micoleta.
 (note 1)Yours truly
E. S. Dodgson.
