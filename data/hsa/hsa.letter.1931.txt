Colombo, 22 February 1890
Dear Sir,
I send you some more books by Jansz. Sorry. Some are so dirty. I learn that he is paralysed and can write no more; but he has some more works in manuscript that he would be glad to sell. I shall see what he wants for them. I hope to get the words of the Caffrinha soon, and shall send them to you.
Yours very truly

Donald Ferguson
