Hôtel Central, Biarritz, B. P. 27 April, 1898.
 Dear Dr. H. Schuchardt, 
I have not yet succeeded in getting Vinsons supplementary Bibliography though I saw a copy of it in Bayonne a fort night ago. In that I notice that Vinson describes your letter (in which you ignore all that I have done, rather tried to do, for Leiçarragà for the last ten years) published in 
L'Avenir some months ago as a 
réponse to that which I published in the number of 4 Décembre 1897. That description is a lie, in Vinsons own style. You complained to Vinson in a letter, which he sent to Cork for my perusal, and to Miss Ferrar in another, which she sent to me also for perusal, that you had never seen my letter. I have already told you that I should have sent you the Avenir of Decr. 4, 
1897, had I received the packet containing ten copies which M
r Arnaud Détroyat tells me was addressed to me at Cork. I never received that packet. I afterwards received one copy, and felt it my duty to keep that as evidence. I have just been to the office of the Avenir where they presented me with three copies of the number in question. I have sent one to you. They confirm Mr. Détroyats statement that a packet of ten was sent to Cork for me. You will see that Vinsons statement, on which you based your answer, is incorrect.
E. S. Dodgson.
