Barcelona. (Lista). 29 Dec: 1894.
Dear Dr Schuchardt, 
I have had your card of Christmas day. I do not keep copies of my letters to you because I thought I was corresponding with a gentleman, capable of teaching me because of his superior academic standing and linguistic training, but incapable of misrepresenting me.. Your last card reveals a state of temper which I regret. I have from the first tried to renconcile land in Basque with Gothic land, but also with the possibility of its coming from Basque lan and its being influenced by planta. I think also I have since 1889 written to you on this subject. If your thoughts agree with mine, what right have you to attack me as not entitled to your respect as a sprachforscher? If you borrow my ideas, and pass them off as original, you have still less right to attack me. If you think me a liar 
in any respect whatever I have only to tell you that this is the last letter I shall send you. What you now say about Baiae ”als baskische ursprungs bezeichnen ich halte das für Unsinn.“ appears to me exactly in contradiction with what you say in the last separat-abdruck sent by you to E. S. Dodgson.
 (note 1) I wrote to you immediately after my visit to Bayona in (note 2) Galicia last Sept: claiming Baiae as Basque because of Bayona in France & Galicia & the Baião & Baiões of Portugal. 
 (note 3) I do not like the Portuguese as a whole or Jose Leite de Vasconcellos among them. Do you wish for my reasons?
