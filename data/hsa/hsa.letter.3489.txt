Dear Dr. H. Schuchardt, 
I am informed from 
Oxford that you have sent thither extracts from or a copy of one of my letters. I have already complained of your communicating to my deceitful enemy Webster what I wrote to you. I am like the Portuguese nun of Beja who wrote the famous letters to Mr. de Chamilly, but got no answer. My link with you was a common love of 
Basque. You asked me to send you Basque books: I have sent you a good many. Your thanks have been mostly curt, & some of your letters positively discourteous. After professing great joy at my publishing the text of Capanaga you wrote on getting it that you would publish 2 lines about it. But, so far as I know, you have not accomplished even that meagre and frigid promise, any more than that of saying something Beruhmend in my favour. You have not told me why you have ceased to write to me. I know not how I have offended you, but I know I have never had any wish but to obtain your friendship, and learn as much as possible from you. I know not what religion, if any, you profess; but if you are a Christian, I think you owe me some explanation.
E. S. Dodgson. 
29 June 1894.
