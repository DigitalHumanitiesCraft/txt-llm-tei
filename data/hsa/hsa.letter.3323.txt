Dear Dr Hugo Schuchardt, 
if you desire to do me a very real and important service be so good as to write at once to Messrs Magalhaës e Moniz, booksellers at Porto, Portugal, to recommend me as highly as you can for a post as Professor of English in Portugal, I know not yet whether in a family or a college, where I understand that I should earn 20 francs a day. I have written myself, but I am not a good hand at singing my own praises. I learned Portuguese during a stay of nearly two months in Brasil in 1885. I spent some weeks in 
Portugal in 1886 and 1887, and have never wholly neglected the language since then. I should be very glad to live in Portugal, and visit every parish that belongs to it for archeological and linguistic purposes.
