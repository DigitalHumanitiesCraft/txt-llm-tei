            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuckardt [sic]</opener>
            <p>your last card reached me in Victoria last Wednesday week after a few days spent in visiting some places in the provinces of Navarra and Logroño where I had never been before, and where it is evident that Basque flourished formerly. I might write much, but limit myself to this card to say you have not yet answered some of my questions. It is pleasant to pass ones reflexions through the sieve of the mind of another who takes an interest in the same studies. My next address will be <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">lista</hi>, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Gijon</hi>, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">P<hi rendition="#sup">a</hi> de Oviedo</hi>. I start tomorrow morning for Cabezon by railway, and shall try to see some places in this province near there before joining the Oviedo railway at Infiesto. I met here two days ago a Souletin from Barcus who says they have there a word <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">kota</hi> meaning a kind of dress. It must be English <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">coat</hi>. I dare say it has long since been suggested that Basque <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
jabe</hi>, pronounced <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">kabe</hi>
               </foreign> by some is related to German and latin <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
habe</hi>. What do you say? and Basque <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">abe</hi>, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
abi</hi>
               </foreign> is it not the root of latin <foreign xml:lang="la">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">abies</hi>
               </foreign>? the column-tree? J. M. de Bernaola has found in the possession of another priest at Durango another <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ms</hi> copy of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Peru Abarca</hi>, taken before the text was printed, &amp; differing here and there from his. In this the word on which Campion gives a note in his grammar is the ordinary <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">me vienen á mí</hi>, without tutoiement. He says the common people have turned <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">anniversariua</hi> into <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">arimen-errosarioa</hi>
               </foreign> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">reumatismua</hi> into <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">erre-bautismua</hi>
               </foreign>! I am glad you share my view about <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ezetz &amp; baietz</hi>
               </foreign>. I announced it in reviewing Azkue in 1892. His Bishop has refused his licence to two of his books, one a catechism. </p>
