            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> H. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>I have to thank you for your work entitled „Der Mehrzielige Frage und Relativsatz“. In return I have sent the 3 gospels in Ainu for your amusement. The other, S<hi rendition="#sup">t</hi> Matthew, is printed all out of order. A new edition of the grammar &amp; Dictionary by the same author is being printed. I despatched on Friday last, the day of publication, the final part of my brochure called on the outside <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">The Basque Verb Found and Defined</hi>, VIII &amp; 36 pages. Say all you can against it. I have not yet read all of your article on <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Loth</persName>, nor all of the latters book – his note on coxa, page 42, seems to me very feeble. If <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">coxa</hi> was both a Brythonic and a Latin word, how can it be said that it was capable of different treatment as <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.203">Brythonic</ref> or Latin, since the Brythonic and the Latin treated it in the same way? A Moriori or a Yahgan considers that an Englishman and a German treat the Gothic hus in the same manner, and would be surprised at <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">haus</hi> or <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">house</hi> being differently treated in the future by the one race or the other. I have dedicated to you my Concordance to Philemon, as published by the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.4686">Société Ramond</ref>. I have not yet got the tirage à part. Inchauspe declined the dedication at the last moment, because he would not believe that I coud quote Calvins French Bible without having a <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">religious respect</hi> for it, which I expressly disclaimed, while saying that I respected the Bible even when badly translated. In Euskara 13, which I only received on Saturday, though it bears the false date of März 15, thus being even more deceitful than the two preceding numbers, as I have pointed out to M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>
               <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Linschmann</persName>, you must insert <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">aditu</hi> between <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">aldiz</hi> and dut in the 2nd line of my shepherds professorial letter. This word was in its place in the proofs, I feel sure; but probably Hannemann, whose emeak instead of emea shows how little he knows <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref>, changed it through ignorance. Is it not nicely written? <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Uhlenbeck</persName> seems to be a great gain to our society. Some of the words discussed by him, as well as elkar in <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> letter against Schwerdfeger, have long since had my attention, as you partly know from my correspondence, as I think <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> does also. I should like one day to draw up a catalogue of the unconfessed faulty translations etc: in the latters Dictionary. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Azkue</persName> has sent me 5 or 6 brochures on basque by Arana, (not father J. I.) of Abando – they have some glimmerings of science. I have sent to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Linschmann</persName> a list of the 95 mistakes in the 95 pages of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinsons</persName> copy of the Petites Oeuvres de Pouvreau. Can you give me your book on <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.202">Keltic</ref>? My debts will not permit me to buy it at present.</p>
