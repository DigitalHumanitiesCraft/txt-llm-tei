            <opener>My dear Doctor Schuchardt,</opener>
            <p>I was glad to see on Wednesday evening that you have not forgotten me, but grieved to read that your nerves are still so troublesome. Studying <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinsons</persName> Bibliographie will not calm them - it is full of misprints on every page, notably in the titles of the books and the numbering of their pages - I have sent you this evening “<ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5710">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">La Union Vasco Navarra</hi>
               </ref>” of Bilbao for Wednesday last containing my list of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">some</hi> of his omissions - they have printed it badly as they generally do in <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Spain</placeName> - <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName> after all I told him more than two years ago says the original of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Leiçarraga</persName> 1571 was of the year 1577 if not of 1616! and that <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Ripalda</persName> published his catechism at the age of 2 years! He is half mad - He will publish in this months <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.3129">Revue de Linguistique</ref> my version of part of the Helaine pastoral - I hope to do the rest when I next go to Bayonne. You will see I have been very literal and the text is correctly printed after two sets of proofs - <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
De Harlez</persName> has not been able to keep his promise and publish in the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Museon</hi> a bit of my <bibl>“<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Dictionariolum topicum et analyticum Verbi Leiçarragani.</hi>”</bibl> On lake Garda which I crossed in Sept: 1890 from <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/> Turbole to Pescheria after walking all the way from Bolsano, one realizes the force of Basque <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">urdiña </hi>
               </foreign>= colour characteristic of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">water </hi>- I never saw such blue, sacrebleu! You will steam about on it a good bit I expect - You should give up tea and coffee and drink <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">yerba maté</hi> or South American tea - strongly recommended by the medical men as good for nerves and intellectual work. Let it <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">draw</hi> longer than Chinese tea, and put chemists charcoal in the pot, and flavour with lemon and sugar - If the Parisian latinists are right in saying that <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">consul</hi> and similar words were anciently, say in <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Ciceros</persName> time, pronounced without <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">n</hi> how do they explain the resuscitation of the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">n</hi> in all the modern languages in the word derived from <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
consul</hi>? when in <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">toise</hi> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">mesa</hi> etc: no such resurrection of a really lost <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">n</hi> has taken place? <pb facs="#IMG.3" n="3"/> I have had a good deal of correspondence with M<hi rendition="#sup">
r</hi>
               <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> the last 6 months - He has very generously given me his big grammar and very imperfect Dictionnary besides his book, often incorrect, on Leiçarragas verb. In a day or two I shall send you <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Inchauspes</persName> “Inferno Canto I” in Souletin, and perhaps a new publication in Biscayan. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Adema</persName> is preparing a collection of Basque songs - <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName> will soon publish <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Pouvreaus</persName> minor inedited writings - I would at once undertake his <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Imitatio</hi> if I were richer. I have been trying to find the means of publishing <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
Capanaga</hi>, which is singularly close to Labourtin in comparison with modern Biscayan. Have you seen <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Azcues</persName> grammar? the <pb facs="#IMG.4" n="4"/> Etudes of Pau published at the End of January my brief critique on it. I have only seen M<hi rendition="#sup">
r</hi>
               <persName ref="[authorityLink]">D’Abbadie</persName> once since he came to town just two months ago - he feels the weight of 4 score years very much, and is much occupied as President of the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.443">Académie des Sciences</ref>, but he often writes to me - I am going on at the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5714">Ecole des Langues Orientales</ref> with Armenian, Modern Greek and Roumanian. Not much work is done by the few students who make use of it - M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>
               <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Picots</persName> new library is a beautiful chamber - Your fame is still green at <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Paris</placeName> - A good many new Basque books have come out since we met at <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Munich</placeName>, 4 or 5 this year even -</p>
