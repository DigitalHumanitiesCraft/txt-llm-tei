            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Schuchardt,</opener>
            <p>thanks for your Gothic or Gotha-ic postcard just received. It is not too late for you to revise the definitions in that part of the proofsheets which I sent you which constitutes the continuation of the part of my Concordance already printed and sent to you. If you can kindly find time to do so, and will send them back on Monday or Tuesday, I may perhaps be saved from some annoying blunder. I see in the Times the announcement of “Comparative Philology of the Old and New Worlds in relation to Archaic Speech”. I expect they will soon have it at the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5043">Sorbonne</ref>. On Wednesday evening I met chez Mr <persName ref="[authorityLink]">E. Picot</persName> your successor at <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.277">Halle</ref>, Professor <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Suchier</persName>, with two of his pupils. They will leave <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Paris</placeName> tomorrow. He spoke most flatteringly of you, but doesnt think you as ill as you imagine. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Gaston Paris</persName> was also there. He will soon be a member of the Academy, which will be all the better for having him in its bosom. I have fixed 5 mark as the price of my Johannine Concordance which when complete will consist of about 42 pages. Your copy is however Corban<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">‘regalo’, hebr. <foreign xml:lang="he">
                     <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">qrbân</hi>
                  </foreign>.</note>. But if you can find me any purchasers I shall be grateful. Some people find it too dear, but they have no idea what heavy and houry work it has been to its compiler. I have already however received that price for four copies of it bought in England. Mr Thomas has finished his copy of the D’Urte Bible, and the Clarendon Press will shortly begin the printing of it. The Dictionary in part and the Grammar entirely have also been placed by Lord Macclesfields consent in the Bodleian for his use. The British and Forane Bible Society have officially asked for my opinion as to the value for evangelistic purposes of an edition of Haraneders New Testament. I cannot say more than I have already written to them on the subject. But it remains to see if the obstinate old lexicographer Mr l'abbé <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Maurice Harriet</persName> of Haltson will consent to its publication. One of the best Labourtin writers Mr E. Lapeyre has been burnt in his library fuora le mure di Bayona, R.I.P.</p>
