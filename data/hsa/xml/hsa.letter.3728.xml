            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt </opener>
            <p>I got your postcard this morning, and conclude that my last must have crossed it. If you had asked me about two months ago, I coud have sent a copy of the last bit of my B. V. F. &amp; D. to Prof: <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Giacomino</persName>. But I sent it to the Public Library at Orthez, and the Mayor while thanking me wrote that there was no one there interested in Basque and the Public had no entrance to the Municipal library, contradicting thus what I had heard from others. I am however writing to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">De Charencey</persName> to ask that the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Actes</hi> of his Society may be sent. I did think myself of sending the book to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Giacomino</persName> when it came out, but was not quite sure of his address. I dont think I have seen any of his own publications. I am sending him a copy of my appendix to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> new book. The latter Bascophile (who seems to be very unfriendly towards me, perhaps through jealousy, or the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">famous stupidity</hi> which M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. A. D'Abbadie attributes to him, or the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">vanity</hi> which <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Webster</persName> does) thinks this appendix useless, and refuses to buy any copies. His publisher has not answered my letter offering to sell him some. I paid the printer 25 francs for it on the 1<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> of May, and your copy was the first sent off. I ask 35 centimes post free for the leaflet. But you owe me nothing "save to love one another", as S<hi rendition="#sup">t</hi>. Paul says. I think I have told you that in Dec: 1894 or Jan: 1895, I called the attention of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName>, <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName>, &amp; the Editor of <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.4157">The Academy</ref> to Larramendis mention of these very proverbs. But he ignored my information, and makes a fool of himself in the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Avant Propos</hi> in consequence. What happens <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">often</hi> will <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">probably</hi> happen <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">soon</hi>. Hence the two meanings of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">sarri</hi> in Basque. A Basquaise said to me the other day "nous arriverons <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">souvent</hi>", or something like that, when it was clear she meant <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">bientôt</hi>. Harriets Dictionary is the only one that defines the common word <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">saldare</hi> = <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">avoine</hi>. He derives it from <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">zaldi-ale</hi> = horse-grain.</p>
