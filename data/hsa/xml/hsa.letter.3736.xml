            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Schuchardt </opener>
            <p>continuing my other card I have to tell you that I have omitted in my list of verbs in <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> proverbs this p. 40 <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ezlemayo</hi>. I found that out about 2 weeks ago. Can you obtain from <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> or his publisher a list of the people or libraries owning copies of his edition, so that I may sent my yellow appendix to them. It cost me 25 francs, paid to the printer on the first of May, and I would rather give it away than let it be wasted. Please inform others of the omission of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ezlemayo</hi>. I have not only, alas!, something to add to the corrigenda of my inscriptions, but, to console me for that, a considerable supplement already, including the inscriptions on two bells cast this month in the monastery, once Benedictine now Franciscan, of Nájera, the Westminster of Navarra. Among the 8 friars 6 are Spanish Basques, a small Euskarian colony where no doubt Basque was spoken in the time of Pompey. At Tricio close by I got 3 Iberian coins with inscriptions. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Fita</persName> thinks one of them may be new to science. I have not yet had <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Huebner</persName>s opinion. Tricio may well have been once the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
guard-town</hi> of the surrounding valley. It once was <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Samiona </hi>that is <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
zain</hi>-<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ona</hi>. Think of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Santoña</hi> on the Biscayan coast, and places called <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">La Guardia</hi> in this peninsular. Many Roman inscriptions &amp; coins have been found there. There are a good many Basques in this city. One sees not a few persons crippled in the awful explosion of Nov: 3, 1893. </p>
