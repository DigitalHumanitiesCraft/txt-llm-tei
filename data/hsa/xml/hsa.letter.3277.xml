            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Schuchardt,</opener>
            <p>since the 27<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> I have been enjoying the blue sky &amp; tranquil moony and sunny heat and cold of Sagium, which the clergy call Séez and the railway and the Post-office Sées. On the way from Paris on Monday I explored the agreeable towns of Dreux and Argentan. It is my first visit to the department of the Orne, in which the Comte <persName ref="[authorityLink]">de Charencey</persName> holds an ancestral property and is Conseiller Général. The department contains a village called <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Larré</hi> and another called <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Urou</hi>, the latter being on the banks of a river URE. To a Bascologist like you this is verbum Sapienti satis! The Iberian Basques must have been here before history begins. The Cathedral here is one of the lovely dreams of the 13<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> century, my century! I received today the first copies of my Concordance from Alençon, to which town I am going on foot on Monday. I have sent you a copy. I find a mistake which confounds me on page 6. I am made to say that <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Dacussana</hi> is <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">imparf</hi>. I am sure I have never thought it to be anything but the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">present</hi>. I see also several other misprints which I do not think existed in my last proof. Please return the proof which I sent to you. Till the 8<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>, when I shall leave Alençon, my address will be Poste Restante there, dep<hi rendition="#sup">t</hi>
               <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Orne.</hi> The conclusion of this section of my severe task will I hope be out in May. You shall have it. It will contain a list of corrigenda. I appeal to you as a man of science for aid against those who are my enemies because I have sought the truth.<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">
