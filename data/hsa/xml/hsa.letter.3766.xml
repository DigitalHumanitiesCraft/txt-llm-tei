            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>I was very glad to get your <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">pleasant </hi>letter this morning. Yesterday I entered on my 41<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> year alas! How much time I have been forced to waste! I was hoping to celebrate the day by publishing the first Basque book printed in Ireland, but have had to delay it because Oregi and <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName> have not chosen to return the proofs sent 9 days ago as <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Campion</persName> has. Do not speak to me about the madness of what you call the grammatical renaissance in Biscaya. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Azkue</persName> and Sabino are both enemies of mine. Before realising their character I committed some of my views to them in writing or by word of mouth, and some of these appear in their works without any acknowledgement of their source! and I can detect blows aimed at me in the dark by them in return. They are not of good family, but puffed up by a superficial education &amp; trying to float on the surface of spanish shallowness &amp; indifference into fame. Go to Bizcaya &amp; seek the oldest &amp; most ignorance [sic] peasants! Go to Garai near Durango &amp; hear the initial <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">H</hi> still sounded! You do not say that you got my supplement to <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5695">
Larramendi</ref>, with etymologies worthy of an Oregi or a <persName ref="[authorityLink]">León Hiriart</persName>. I have written to <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.3286">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">the Athenaeum</hi>
               </ref> about the announcement it made last week that your Academy is to publish <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5677">Leiçarraga</ref>. I will try to submit a few plain questions to you about <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref> in <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.203">Breton</ref> &amp; Irish <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.901">Gaelic</ref>.</p>
