            <opener>Dear Prof<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>whoever it is that has poisoned M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> D’Abbadies mind against me, it is certain that he or she has succeeded. He has never thanked me for the 2<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi> part of my supplement to Vinson, for my copy of the proverbs, for many Basque publications sent to him by me, for my <bibl>
                  <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.bibliography#BIBL.4322">
                     <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Basque Verb Found and Defined</hi>
                  </ref>
               </bibl>, or for the beginning of my edition of Capanaga, of which the first 40 pages have been definitively printed off, and the type distributed. I felt a filial affection for M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> D’Abbadie, and he has made me several handsome presents - But he is a henpecked husband with a very eccentric wife, who has made much bad blood in Basqueland. I wrote to him in vain, as to many other Bascophiles, for pecuniary and for my Capanaga, of which I have sent you three sets of proofs, which you can keep. Please tell <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Linschmann</persName> to write to me. You give no reason for rejecting my thoughts about <foreign xml:lang="pt">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
Leilão</hi>
               </foreign>, and you do not answer my suggestions about Basque and Portuguese <foreign xml:lang="pt">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
mamoa</hi>
               </foreign>. What shall I do with the superfluous beginning of your great work on the verb? I have not yet read all. I am reading Ariostos <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Lena</hi> in an edition of 1620. </p>
