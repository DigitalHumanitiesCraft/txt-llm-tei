            <opener>Dear Schuchardt,</opener>
            <p>I have at last got a word inserted in the Academy and I hope you will approve of it: my idea was in not giving any names this time that it would be well to keep it before the public and give you an opportunity of communicating the names to Dr. Appleton<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">
                  <persName>

Charles Edward Appleton</persName> (1841–1879), Begründer und Herausgeber der Zeitschrift "<ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.4157">The Academy</ref>".</note> yourself and of writing anything you wish him to have published in the “<ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.4157">Academy</ref>” at the same time. I have great pleasure in giving you permission to use my name as one of those to receive <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/> subscriptions for the Diez Prize-fund; however I fear we shall not have much money to account for. Mrs. Rhys came home last week wonderfully altered for the better.</p>
            <p>I am much obliged to you for the brochure you have sent me:<note n="2" place="foot" type="editorial">Referenz unklar.</note> I have read it carefully through.</p>
            <p>By the way I should be much obliged to you for any corrections you can give me in my “Lectures”. The edition consisted of 500 copies and we made a mistake in printing so few it seems: for already <pb facs="#IMG.3" n="3"/> about 400 copies have been disposed of and that before the book has been reviewed in England with the exception of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Sayce</persName>’s in the Academy for the 12th of this month<note n="3" place="foot" type="editorial">

Sayce</persName> (1845–1933) war Orientalist und Sprachwissenschaftler und zudem Pate von <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Myfanwy Rhŷs</persName>.</note> which could not be the cause of so many copies having already gone. So the publisher is already talking of a second edition and wants me to prepare for it. However I must wait for reviews and various corrections for which I should be most grateful to you, especially as far as concerns my treatment of inscriptional Latin in which I feel very <pb facs="#IMG.4" n="4"/> shaky and very uncertain as to how much is to be put down to Latin and how much to Celtic: what are the books of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">D’Arbois de Jubainville</persName>
