            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt,</opener>
            <p>I need nothing so much as a friendly critic like you with an interest in <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref>, for I am, at least here, like the peak of the Maladetta in a state of too serene and chilly isolation. I see Dr <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Larrieu</persName> occasionally but he is not much of a philologist and only knows Souletin well. My Bas Navarrais student (medical) is a young savage and we have quarrelled. In my last card read sulphonal - I must have been thinking of Basque lan. In another card strike out the accent on deçala, for the accent makes it a 2nd person. You see I have a literary conscience which awakes too late always! Best thanks for writing to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">G. Paris</persName>. I passed him yesterday in the gloomy portal of the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5047">Hautes Etudes</ref> but did not dare to speak. He always looks so severe! I will however break the ice now armed with your letter. I have hitherto felt like an interloper in the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5047">H. E.</ref> for they have never given me a carte d’étudiant there and I have made no pretense of doing any work for Duvau, <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Gaidoz</persName>, <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Morel Fatio</persName>, or <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Paris</persName>, or <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Psichari</persName>, whose classes I have from time to time followed. But I see in the annuaire that they enroll me in their list of members. I have corrected the 4th and I suppose final proofs of my Concordance to the part of St John of which you will shortly have the separatabdruck. I can only send you today the 3rd proof. My Esthonian teacher says that a belle mère is called in his language emaste. impossible not to think of Basque. So too einhe the shepherds gônter or luncheon is very like Basque ainhu the shepherds pittance!</p>

More of my Dechepare is soon to appear in the Etudes at <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Pau</placeName>. have you Peru Abarca? tell me! it is worth studying and is still on sale at Bilbao.</p>
