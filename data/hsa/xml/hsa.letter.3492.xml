            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>many thanks for your <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.bibliography#BIBL.569">
article on the attempted catalogue</ref> of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Victor Collins</persName> which came this morning. I shall read it this afternoon before leaving Coimbra. I am going to spend two nights at Espinho on the coast &amp; 7 at Oporto. At Compostela, where I expect to arrive on the 24<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>, I shall look at the manuscript containing the oldest known glossary of Basque, and see if Father Fita has published it correctly. If I try to find mistakes in other peoples work it is because experience has taught me that they are generally to be found, because it is a duty to truth &amp; science to point them out. It does not follow, as you gratuitously assume, that I pretend to be faultless. On the contrary I am sincerely thankful to anyone who will correct me in the right spirit, and should be freer from mistakes if I had more help from others. We cannot see our own mistakes without external aid, and we are very irrational if we are offended at being told of them. Vinson has at last mentioned you in the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Revue de Linguistique.</hi> I had no proof for my latest article therein, and Vinson has made a mess of it; but promises that I shall be able to print a corrigendum. Look at his page 434, and the omission of 105 among the works of Cardaberaz will shew you how I came to accuse him falsely of omitting that book. I must often have read its title in perusing his Bibliography. I went the other day to Agueda on purpose to see if the adjoining parish of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Oyan</hi> is <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">woody</hi>, and found it to be little more than a pine forest. So I am convinced it is a Basque name and as <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">oian</hi>
               </foreign> is one of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Hübner</persName>s Iberian words I identify the two. At Agueda there is a family named <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Sucéna</hi> which is simply a Basque name. Have you published anything on <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Hübner</persName>s book? I think it confirms the Iberian origin of Basque. <foreign xml:lang="eu">Vinsonek ezdeu ikusten hau itsua baita</foreign>. His appendix to D’Urte is very incomplete and often wrong e. g. about <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">bait</hi> = because.</p>
