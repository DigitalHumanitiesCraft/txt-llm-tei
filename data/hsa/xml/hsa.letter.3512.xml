            <opener>Dear Professor Hugo Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>I have to thank you for your article on <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Leskien</persName> received some days ago. I have not had time to read it. You have not sent me that on <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName>, which, to judge by the proof I had, is the weakest thing written by you so far as I know. I have today got your <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Baskisch und Germanisch</hi>. It is very interesting. But I claim to be the first Bascologist who has mentioned the probability of the connection if not between Basque <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">landa</hi> and Germanic &amp; neolatin words of the same meaning and sound at least of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
Baiae</hi> in South Italy being Basque, like other place-names down there, and so I think you ought to have mentioned me in dealing with these words. I have plenty of etymologies in connection with Basque which I believe to be new. When I communicate them to you, as was the case with <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Baiae</hi>, if not land in my <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5757">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Eskualduna</hi>
               </ref> article of 1888, you do not answer them, but you speak of them in your publications without any mention of me. I cannot find anyone to publish my writings on Basque. So I think you ought to be more generous, and at least answer such of my questions which I submit to you in my private letters. I have been up to San Juan de las Abadesas; Ripoll, &amp; Vich<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">Heute: Vic.</note>, and coud say much to you about my philological observations. Professor J. [sic] Max Müller has written to say he wrote to the Clarendon Press in favour of my article on D’Urte, but fears nothing can be done. </p>
