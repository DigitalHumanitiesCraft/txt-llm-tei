            <opener>Dear Professor Schuchardt,</opener>
            <p>I hope that you will let me have some sign of your existence and of your friendship (for I believe this exists in spite of your occasional rudeness) &amp; also an opinion on the little work which I have dedicated to you. Only 25 copies of it were granted to me. The heat here has been very great for the last few days. It is almost settled that I am to go to a college at Vizeu in <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Portugal</placeName> to begin in September to teach English, French, and German. For many reason I have wished and I believe that you will be able to share my wish to be settled in the Basque region so that I may while earning money and being usefully occupied continue the study of Basque which inspires me more and more deeply with a monomaniacal passion. It appears from Leiçarragas glossary that Larraina in old Labourdin meant threshing-floor, aire, area. I suppose this explains the place-name Larraine in Soule which the French call Larrau. I am sending a copy of this glossary to the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.4686">Société Ramond</ref> to appear in company with my S<hi rendition="#sup">t</hi> Jude which they are now printing, and I am adding the equivalents in French. On page 84 of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Basme</hi> by Stăncescu. (Bucuresca 1893) the words <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">cine stie ce</hi> would have done well for your recent pamphlet. Where do you mean to spend the summer? I suppose <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Priebsch</persName> will turn up here at the end of this month. Did I tell you that I had bought a copy of Larramendis grammar 1729 which looks as good as new? It cost 10 francs.</p>
