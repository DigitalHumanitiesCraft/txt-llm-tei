            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. H. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>I hope that you are now in a better temper. As soon as you accused me of plagiarism about <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">acheter</hi> I forwarded your reminder to <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.4157">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">the Academy</hi>
               </ref>. I do not think they published it. I am going to repeat my retractation of the truly false statement I made in April. But I had totally forgotten, if I ever saw, your discovery. I cannot find the brochure or sheet which you say you sent me, and which contained it. Perhaps it was in one of the Basque books which were stolen from me at Coimbra, <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Webster</persName>s inscriptions, Hariztoy on <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Altabizcarko Cantua</hi> and <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> big grammar, all presents from the authors, made about the date of your article. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Carolina Michaelis</persName> says she has sent the letter, and hopes that our quarrel will end. She has sent me the edition of Herders Cid of 1868 in which she had a hand at the age of 16. I have much to talk to you about in the field of Basque, but hardly dare say anything, as you are so unjust and unreasonable. I have lately been for the first time through the Roncalese villages of Garde, Roncal, Urzainki, Isaba, where Basque is weakening very much. Even the z of <foreign xml:lang="eu">

               </foreign>, their form of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">zu(r)bia</hi>, the bridge is pronounced th as if it were Castilian, at least by the few younger people who know Basque. I have also been for the first time in the Souletin villages of S<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">a</hi>. Engracia, Esquiule, Barkotche<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">Barcus.</note>, and Shohute (Charaute). I began at Oloron my Concordance to the 488 forms of the Apocalypse &amp; completed it in 17 days all but the French<note n="2" place="foot" type="editorial">Fortsetzung am rechten Rand.</note> quotations. That of Timothy will be<note n="3" place="foot" type="editorial">Fortsetzung am linken Rand.</note> published in September or October there. </p>
