            <p>Are you aware that beneath the Louisiana Creole – French there lies hidden a much more esoteric - a deeper and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">darker</hi> dialect?

This <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Gumbo </hi>is kept very secret and is peculiarly the language of the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Voudoo </hi>(or Vūdū) negroes. The Voudoo is a kind of conjuror, sorcerer or magician. So far as I have learned (and I have learned a great deal) their rites and practices correspond precisely <pb facs="#IMG.3" n="3"/> to those of Africa, as these do to the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Shamans</hi> of Central or Eastern Asia. The word <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Voudoo</hi> is derived from a Western Indian word <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Vaudoux</hi> (French orthography) signifying serpent.

               </note> which has just appeared has as far been very kindly received. Such of your Austrian Zigeuner as I have seen here - only 3 - seem to be very nice pleasant people. Yesterday afternoon I went with my niece Miss Elizabeth Robins<note n="8" place="foot" type="editorial">
                  <persName>
Elizabeth Robins Pennell</persName> (1855-1936), Leland’s niece, author of various essays, art criticisms, biographies, including her uncle’s biography, travel books, and a novel (<bibl>

                  </bibl>). According to Kruesi (1999: 4), “Elizabeth found inspiration in the work of her uncle, the author Charles Godfrey Leland (1824-1903), who was a stimulating companion, introducing her to other writers, including his friends Walt Whitman (1819-1892) and George H. Boker (1823-1890). Leland took her with him on his visits to gypsy encampments in New Jersey and Pennsylvania for his book The Gypsies. He encouraged her to write and gave her introductions in the offices of Philadelphia's newspapers.”</note> (who speaks anglo-zigeunerisch very well) to visit the old poet Walt Whitman – after seeing him we took a walk in the country, and being thirsty, I went into a beerhouse, leaving my niece without. While there, in came a wild looking <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Strassenlaufer</hi> or <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
Landstreicher</hi>
               <pb facs="#IMG.4" n="4"/> (Landloofer, Hollandisch) a dark, hawk-faced fellow, a wandering umbrella mender. He spoke German, but I saw in his face that he was Gypsy. But he would not admit it – he denied it – and when I said “Bist du nicht <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Romani</hi>?” he replied “Nein ich bin ein <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Protestant</hi>.” But though I was disappointed I said to the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Wirthinn</hi> – “Giebt dem lieben Mann ein Glass Bier.” Whereupon with a droll look he said “Was ist <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">chadscherdi</hi>
               <note n="9" place="foot" type="editorial">Cf. <bibl>

The Wirthsleute thought we were talking French. There are two camps of old fashioned English gypsies near this city now. They live in tents but have a carpet on the ground and only drink out of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">silver </hi>cups. One of them showed me a watch and chain, on Sunday with the jeweller’s bill. It had cost <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">457</hi> dollars. I never saw <pb facs="#IMG.5" n="5"/> so much gold in a watch and chain as there was in this – Gypsies are the same all the world over. Do you have the Atlantic Monthly in Graz? If so I wish that you would kindly look over the numbers during the past year, and examine a few articles by my niece Miss Robins.

            <p>You should learn German Gypsy. It is <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">very</hi> easy and is a very beautiful soft language. Has anything been published of late on Zigeunerisches in Germany?</p>
            <p>It is worth mentioning that all over the Western United States as well as in the Southern (US.) the ground nut (<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Arachia</hi>
               <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">hypogaea</hi>) is called a <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">gooba</hi> pea. In Africa it is always called simply a <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">g</hi>ū<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">

The negroes and indeed the common children here in Philadelphia say <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Sadi</hi> (<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">a</hi> as in hat – the sound does not exist in German) for I thank you.

            <p>The <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Gumbo</hi> patois is said to be used extensively on the North Eastern coast of South America where Voodooism most prevails. I understand that it is a secret language. I will try to get you specimens of it. I suspect that there are several strange <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
