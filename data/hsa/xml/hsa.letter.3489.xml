            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. H. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>I am informed from <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">
Oxford</placeName> that you have sent thither extracts from or a copy of one of my letters. I have already complained of your communicating to my deceitful enemy <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Webster</persName> what I wrote to you. I am like the Portuguese nun of Beja who wrote the famous letters to M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. de Chamilly, but got no answer. My link with you was a common love of <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">
Basque</ref>. You asked me to send you Basque books: I have sent you a good many. Your thanks have been mostly curt, &amp; some of your letters positively discourteous. After professing great joy at my publishing the text of Capanaga you wrote on getting it that you would publish <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">2 lines</hi> about it. But, so far as I know, you have not accomplished even that meagre and frigid promise, any more than that of saying something <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Beruhmend</hi> in my favour. You have not told me why you have ceased to write to me. I know not how I have offended you, but I know I have never had any wish but to obtain your friendship, and learn as much as possible from you. I know not what religion, if any, you profess; but if you are a Christian, I think you owe me some explanation.</p>
