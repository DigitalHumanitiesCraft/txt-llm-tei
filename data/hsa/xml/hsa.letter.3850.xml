            <opener>Dear Sir</opener>
            <p>I have read with great pleasure your letter. I had almost forgotten my little work on Pidgin English<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">
                  <bibl>

                  </bibl>.</note>. It was very unsuccessful and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">very</hi> severely handled by every reviewer. I only saw one German review of it in which I was treated with a degree of contempt and bitterness which was quite inexplicable. It is true that a book on such a subject is of no great literary value, but a man hardly deserves for all that, to be treated as a <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">hostis humani generis</hi>
               <note n="2" place="foot" type="editorial">Translation: ‘An enemy to human kind’.</note> for writing it. The result was that I made no further study of Pidgin and do not like to think of the poor little book. I sincerely hope that whatever you may write on that - or any other -  subject, may be far more successful. Singularly enough my work <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Fusang</hi>

            <p>I have been assured by a gentleman who was many years in China that a slight <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/> Pidgin French had begun to develop some 10 or 15 years ago. You should write to the French Consuls in China for information.</p>
            <p>I am very much astonished that you are not aware that there is a Japanese Pidgin English<note n="4" place="foot" type="editorial">A trade <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.555">pidgin</ref> spoken in the port of Yokohama (<placeName ref="[authorityLink]">

                  </bibl>: 82f), this pidgin can be classified as a pre-pidgin.</note>. It sprang up in Yokohama and in two years became so formed that an American, Mr. Hoffman Atkinson<note n="5" place="foot" type="editorial">Col.

            <p>Mr. Atkinson made this manual of the dialect so very funny – so like Rabelais<note n="7" place="foot" type="editorial">

                  </bibl>: 806), “This contributor is almost certainly Mr. Arthur Diósy, who later (1891) helped to found the Japan Society, London, of which for many years he was an energetic officer”.</note>. I forgot the name of the magazine - I only remember that it was <pb facs="#IMG.3" n="3"/> the year 1879 and that Mr. Kegan Paul<note n="11" place="foot" type="editorial">Born 1828 in Somerset, died 1902 in London.

            <p>The Yokohama Pidgin is more interesting, amusing and naïf than the Chinese. In it the verb <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">arimas</hi> is used for almost any action of the mind – it is all verbs in one. It is so scanty that a man with a good memory might acquire the whole of it in two or three days, and yet it really serves for all ordinary purposes of conversation. I do not however wonder at it -  for 600 words are all that an average young lady “in society” requires to express her wants and feelings as developed by dress and flirtation. </p>
            <p>The <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.349">Creole French of Louisiana</ref> deserves special study.</p>
            <p>I am now publishing a book on The Gypsies<note n="12" place="foot" type="editorial">
                  <bibl>
                     <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.bibliography#BIBL.3579">Leland (1882b)</ref>
                  </bibl>.</note> which will be interesting because it is the first containing proof that there is in India a peculiar tribe of Gypsies, calling themselves by the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">same name (Rom)</hi> and using the same language as the Gypsies of the more Western word. I <pb facs="#IMG.4" n="4"/> learned this from one of them a Hindū in England. </p>
            <p>After my Pidgin English appeared I received a few valuable contributions to the subject. But I was so much disheartened with the severe treatment which the book had received that I did not keep them. It is my opinion that reviewers do more harm than good, by thus discouraging writers. </p>
