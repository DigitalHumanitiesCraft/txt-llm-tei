            <opener>Dear Sir.</opener>
            <p>I thank you for your supplement to your <bibl>
                  <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.bibliography#BIBL.421">Vinson Recension</ref>
               </bibl> received tonight. I hope <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Dubarat</persName> has sent you, as I asked, the 1<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> number of his <ref target="https://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb34404340n">Revue</ref>, and that you will mention this, as I led him to hope, in one of your articles. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName> is not very obliging about affording facilities for copying into my Capanaga what is lacking in it from the copy belonging to Eusebio Lopez, which he retains against the owners wish! he will not let me copy it except in the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5057">Bib: Nat:</ref> on Tuesday &amp; Thursday next I am afraid that my article in the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5717">Revue des Bibliothèques</ref> which will be published in a few days and which I shall send you will not improve his friendship towards me. I of course find I have omitted many things which I might have said therein. The heat has been severe here lately: it will be roasting in <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Basqueland</placeName>. I leave D. V. on the 8<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>. <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Paris</placeName> is always fatiguing to me. I have begun to learn Esthonian from a native who has studied it well - he learns English from me and goes to <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">England</placeName> shortly - next winter we shall continue - he knows <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.653">Finnish</ref>, <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.639">Russian</ref>, and German also, and will be very useful. his name is Dido (or <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Tüdu</hi>). I introduced him to a Basque today whose poem to me I shall send you. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Priebsch</persName> went off to England on the 1<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> I never saw him in the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5057">Bib: Nat:</ref> and I believe the Austrian Embassy here refused to recommend him. I have returned to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Dubarat</persName> the proofs of my edition of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Dechepare</persName> with translation, which he is going to publish. I have been invited by L’Association Française pour l’Avancement des Sciences to attend and promise to take part in the discussions on the Basques and their language at the Congrès de <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Pau</placeName> 15 – 22 Sept<hi rendition="#sup">re</hi>. I hope you will come to it. I am hindered and depressed you know continually by the brutality of my family and the wretched pittance which they are not ashamed to give me. I think I told you I heard <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">bai</hi> for “yes” in Umbria near Spellum &amp; <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Spoletum (Ezpeleta)</placeName> with its big box-groves. It is also used on the west coast of <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">France</placeName>
