            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>you accuse me in your card received this morning of having borrowed from you, and without acknowledgement published, the derivation of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">acheter</hi>, proposed in my last letter in <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.4157">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">The Academy</hi>
               </ref>. You say you sent me an extract from <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.3085">Gröbers Zeitschrift</ref> in which you made the same suggestion. <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">I have no recollection of having received or seen any such article. I thought the etymon was really a new one coined in my own brain</hi>. It occurred to me last July or June if I recollect rightly and as I was reading an article in some French review I think the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.4980">Revue des Deux Mondes</ref>, and I think it was at Coimbra in the University Library. It was about the administration of some Belgian town in the 15<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> century I think. I remember telling Madame <persName ref="[authorityLink]">C. de Vasconcellos</persName> about it at Vizella. And I remember proposing it in a card to you and you never answered it. When I am again in possession of my Basque library which I had to leave at Banyuls I shall seek for the article, and, if I find it in my possession, and if the date suits your accusation, I shall, if I remember, having read it, have only to say that I had forgotten it when the origin of acheter occurred to me last summer. I never accused you of borrowing from me the connection between land in Basque and other languages. That is as old as the hills. I think Poça, Perochegi, and even Merula mention it. So does Van Eys. But I do feel convinced that in a recent article about Baiae and a certain fountain in Biscaya you plagiarised from a certain card that I wrote just after my visit to Bayona in Galicia last year, because the concatenation<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">Fortsetzung am rechten Rand.</note> of ideas is so wonderfully similar.</p>
