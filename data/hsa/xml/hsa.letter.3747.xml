            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> H. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>I got your letter of the 3<hi rendition="#sup">rd</hi> only tonight. The above will be my address from tomorrow afternoon till further notice. Tomorrow I have to call on the British Consul to ask for the help, which F<hi rendition="#sup">o</hi> R. M. denies, against my printer. <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">It would be too long to give you here all the details of the quarrel</hi>: but as I chose the printer on the recommendation of Don F. R. M. who accompanied me in making the first and then the reduced contract, which I foolishly (but out of respect for F. R. M. who told me the man was <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">de confianza</hi>) only had partially put in writing, I feel hurt at his deserting me at the last moment, as I feel sure his conscience must tell him, I am right. If I cannot get it settled by the Consul, I shall appeal to the public in some newspaper, and quote your last kind letter, as I have no bascologists here to defend me, though a good many have written applauding my Micoleta. My patient correspondent M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Barwick, who is correcting this week the final proofs of the two final <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
pliegos</hi>, pp 17-32, does not know <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref>. It is clear from the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">MS</hi> that M. never revised it himself, or as it seems from the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">grammar</hi>, that he knew Basque very little. I met here lately two granddaughters of Novia de Salcedo. They told me <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">he</hi> too knew not Basque. <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">So I always thought</hi>. When I first read at Barna in 96 the first edition of M. I thought <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Ɩ.</hi> must be <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">vel</hi>. But elsewhere he puts <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">o</hi>, and uses no latin.</p>
