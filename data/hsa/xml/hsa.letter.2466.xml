            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Schuchardt</opener>
            <p>I knew you would accuse me of that “<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
Würtemberg</hi>“ instead of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Baden</hi>, of which my conscience accused me so violently one minute after I had posted it, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">not as the result of ignorance but of sheer nervousness and the fact that I was thinking of asking you to address your answer to Ulm</hi>, that I nearly wrote another card on other words. I wonder you didnt also tell me that I wrote <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">thumba</hi> instead of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">thumpa</hi> as a Basque word which I found in Salaberrys handy Navarrese wordbook. You know that in Rumonsch <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ent</hi> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">enten</hi> mean “<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">in</hi>” and “among = inter” - that seemed to me an additional reason for making <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">indu = in</hi> negative in <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">induperator = imperator</hi>. I find now that I ought to have sent you an inland postcard instead of a 10 pfennig one from Lörrach - how Euskarian it is to say 10 pfennig or mark instead of pluralizing the noun! – I find in Alemanish bisz = Basque <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">biz</hi>
               </foreign> = <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">sei</hi> as in hala<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">biz</hi> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">aeti</hi>
               <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">aita</hi> which I have long suspected of <pb facs="#IMG.1" n="2"/> being child or parent of Gothic <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">atta</hi> &amp; close to Irish - There is a good deal in this dialect that resembles our Anglosaxon curtness. I left Basel on Friday after exactly and etymologically a fortnight spent in exploring the environs. (If Belchen were not pronounced with <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ch</hi> = <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">k</hi> (Balkan) I should feel sure it was Basque = black, swart, but the pronunciation may have changed owing to the orthography – Basilea, Urach, Atsenbach, Kandel (cf: Canigo = gañ-igo - cf: Igon a Basque village) = gain, gañ &amp; others in Baden look like Basque words). Went by train to Lörrach whence on foot to Schopfheim where I saw the storks on the church &amp; thought of Dante &amp; his “cicognin” - thence by train to Todtnau and on foot to Feldberg-hôtel - on Saturday I went to the summit to see the sunrise, but the Alps did not chuse to shew themselves: Thence I walked to the Titi-see, &amp; bathed in its inky waters, - thence walked to Freiburg by the <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="3"/> heavenly valley - After enjoying the glorious Cathedral &amp; peeping at Fischers rock-denkmal in the University &amp; listening to the military and garden bands, by the evening train to Neustadt, seeing the Titi by moon instead of sunlight - Neustadt has some 90 English speaking people but they didnt know at my inn what a poached egg is any more than in Spain! after France what a contrast is Catholic Baden, where one finds crucifixes in the very cafés &amp; restaurants! not a bad one in my opinion since the irreligion of France produces so many horrid results - I cannot believe in a man who does not believe in a God and I cannot believe in a God if it is not Christ Crucified! - would that my life corresponded better with my belief! Yesterday I walked from Neustadt to Donaueschingen where I drank of the Donauquelle &amp; bathed in the Brega where it joins the Brügg in the gardens of the <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="4"/> Prince zu Furstenberg, who is expected there on Thursday from Heiligenberg on this lake. I also visited the Museum. It is a pretty summer “thoking” place, as one says in Wykehamical slang. Yester even by train &amp; songless (except train-noises) Singen - This morning as it was cloudy &amp; had been raining - instead of going up Scheffels Hohentwyl I came by train to Schaffhausen, saw the falls, bathed in the town, &amp; on by boat to Konstanz where I find your card. I had for company M<hi rendition="#sup">
r</hi> G. Treherne (of Wales though his name is Cornish) &amp; his wife &amp; two daughters. I quite converted him to Euskarism - Here I shall be till the 5<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> Aug: I <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">hope</hi> to meet you in the Tyrol, but will write again. Webster tells me that M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rendition="#sup">rs</hi> A. d’Abbadie are on their way to Ober-Ammergau - After at least a weeks fine &amp; hot weather comes rain &amp; thunder tonight. I asked Linschmann to send you Euskara, no 7. I shall walk all over Reichenau-iland. Some of this years Bayonne Basque publications have no printed original to serve as a translation. I think M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Henry Gaidoz from whom I had a card this morning would like to have <note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">Dodgson fährt auf der linken Seite fort.</note> an article from you on the relations between Basque &amp; Keltic for the Revue Celtique. I like to think that Victoria is but the latin of British <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Boadicea</hi>!</p>
