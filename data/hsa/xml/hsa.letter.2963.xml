            <opener>My dear sir,</opener>
            <p>Your letter of the 4th Jan. addressed to me in India has reached me here. If I had been at all in India I should have been happy to endeavour to obtain for you the information you desire respecting the local varieties of the Indo-Portuguese language<note n="2" place="foot" type="editorial">Caldwell appears to have written “languages” originally, but the final “s” was later partly erased.</note> spoken on the Coromandel Coast.<note n="3" place="foot" type="editorial">Coromandel was at the time a current name for the Southeatern coast of <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">India</placeName>, roughly corresponding to the coastal stretch of the modern-day state of Tamil Nadu.</note> There is a considerable number of Indo-Portuguese Christians in all the large towns on <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/> the Coast, including especially S<hi rendition="#sup">
t</hi>.. Thomé, a suburb of Madras.<note n="4" place="foot" type="editorial">“S<hi rendition="#sup">t</hi>.. Thomé” refers to one of the earliest Portuguese settlements in Southeast India, known in Portuguese as <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">São Tomé de Meliapore</hi> and currently, in English, as <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Mylapur</hi>/<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Mylapore</hi>. The Portuguese settlement formed around the alleged tomb of St. Thomas and, though originally a discrete town, had by the time of this letter already been engulfed by the growing metropolis of <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Madras</placeName> (modern-day Chennai).</note> Most of these persons have ceased to speak Portuguese, but in the recently published Reprint of the Indian Census of 1881 (Vol I, p 200) – I find that 3,641 persons are entered as speaking Portuguese in the Madras Presidency.<note n="5" place="foot" type="editorial">The Madras Presidency, one of the major administrative divisions of British India, had at this time jurisdiction over much of South India, including territories that belong to the present-day states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.</note> The remarks contained in that pera might be interesting to you.</p>
            <p>I do not expect to return to India till about the end of the year, but the best suggestion I can give you is <pb facs="#IMG.3" n="3"/> that you should allow me to send your letter to a friend of mine in Madras, the Rev. D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>.. Bower<note n="6" place="foot" type="editorial">
                  <persName>

Henry Bower</persName> (1812-1885), an Anglo-Indian missionary born in <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">
Madras</placeName> (Chennai). He was a renowned scholar of <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.3386">Tamil</ref>, with several publications and translations to his credit.</note>, an eminent Dravidian scholar, who has, I think, some acquaintance with the Indo-Portuguese, and who at all events will be able to make the needful enquiries for you.</p>
            <p>On hearing from you in reply I shall send him your letter, accompanied by a request from myself. Unfortunately, the Indian scholar best acquainted <pb facs="#IMG.4" n="4"/> with Portuguese, D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>.. Burnell,<note n="7" place="foot" type="editorial">
