            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt </opener>
            <p>the sending lately of some numbers of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">The Season</hi> containing articles by myself will have shewn you that I still believe you to feel some interest in my work. Yesterday I saw in <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">The Times</hi> that a marriage between the families of Von Göler Ravensburg and von und zu Gilsa had been celebrated on the 4<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> at Völkershausen, Wanfried by the Rev: W. Schuchardt. Is this clergyman a kinsman of yours? I have lately received from D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Carolina Michaelis</persName> her brochures entitled <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Zum Liederbuch des Königs Denis von Portugal</hi> (Halle 1895) and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
Randglossen zum altportugiesischen Liederbuch</hi> (Halle 1896) and a <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">separatabdruck</hi> about the Visconde de Sanches de Baena, and a long letter in Portuguese. She and Miss Ei still practise the Basque numerals which I taught them in Vizella. When I was at Barcelona in January 1895 and the preceding month I was studying <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5695">Larramendi</ref> with much attention in the University Library, and noticed the mention he makes of the book of proverbs anew discovered by M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>
               <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName>. The note of the latter informing me of his discovery is dated 31 Dec 1894. Just before or after I wrote to him to say what I had read, but not I think for the first time, in the great Dictionary. But as you see all in Vain. I may have written to you, as I did to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName> and <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.4157">The Academy</ref>, about the same thing. My letter was not published I believe either by Vinson or the Academy. You received I hope my little appendix to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> important edition. I must try and see the original at Darmstadt some day. Did I tell you of the Spanish judge who stated in reply to my question at the table d'hôte at Jaca last May that the reason why Pyrenean passes are called <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
portus</hi>, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">puerto</hi>, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">port </hi>rather than <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">porta</hi>, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">porte</hi>, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">puerta</hi>, which would seem more natural, that it was a proof that during Noahs flood ships &amp; people sought refuge in the Pyrenees? <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Smoke</hi> causes <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">shadow</hi>. In the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Manuale di Letteratura Albanese </hi>del Prof. Alberto Straticò (Milano 1896) Xee = ombra, Xe<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">a</hi> = la ombra.<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">Fortsetzung am rechten Seitenrand.</note> This is very like Basque. <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
