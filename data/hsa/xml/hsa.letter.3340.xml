            <opener>Dear Professor Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>I found á la lista this morning your letter of the 12<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> of August. I thought it was <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">you</hi> who were confusing forms of deitu and eritsi and I believe I said so when you sent me a list of words for the abbé Harizpe. I have never I think mixed them up. Yes, <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Webster</persName> has excommunicated me and I dont lose much by it. His prostrate adoration of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName> is supremely ridiculous, especially when he calls himself “a priest of the Church of England”! I look upon him as a vain, coldblooded, insincere, inaccurate, and falsely reputed learned, mischiefmaker. I will tell M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>
               <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Thomas</persName>, indeed I think I have already told him that you would be glad to see the proofsheets of his Edition of D’Urte. I have told Inchauspe that <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
matsi</hi> is not an Esthonian word and that <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
gymnites</hi> does not mean <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">frondeurs</hi>, but naked athletes. I coud not fix on a definition or translation for diraustaçu, and so I threw the burden on Inchauspe in a note published in the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Etudes</hi> at <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Pau</placeName>. My epitaph on <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Webster</persName> is this “Here lies a little person who lived for twenty years among the Basques without learning their language”. I sent you on Monday the 701<hi rendition="#sup">st</hi> number of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">La Union Vascongada</hi> containing my poem <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Kiriskiletachoa</hi>. The 6<hi rendition="#sup">
th</hi> number of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">La Concha</hi> will be out tomorrow I think, containing, like its predecessors, of which I sent you the first, a poem in Basque. I have excommunicated <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Arzac</persName>, and look upon him as a thief and a liar. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Vinson</persName> says he has sent me a proof of my article on Dechepares metre, but I have not got it. Don José Maria Arrue has shewn me his father Gregorios manuscript of 790 pages well written in Guipuzcoan. It is a life of S<hi rendition="#sup">
t</hi> Ignacio de Loyola which the provincial Diputacion to whom it is dedicated ought to publish as they have suppressed Oreguis chair. I walked up in a trifle over an hour to Igueldo to see the barbarous basque agricultural sport called <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">idi</hi>- (almost <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">iri</hi>) <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">dema</hi>. It is going on at this moment before the church, and consists of a ring of betters (who ought to know better than to aid and abet such beastly cruelty) watching two oxen yoked who have to draw two huge stones while a furious basque calling out haida, haida, savagely pricks their hindquarters and flanks with a goad till the blood flows. The judges sit a little way off at a table and the object of the performance is to test the relative strength of the poor oxen. Send your work well-bound to the Queen of Spain as well as to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">V. L. A. Stempf</persName>, 15 Pavé des Chartrons, Bordeaux, and <persName ref="[authorityLink]">R. M. de Azkue</persName>, 1 Campo Volantin 1,<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">Fortsetzung den rechten Rand hinauf.</note> Bilbao.</p>
