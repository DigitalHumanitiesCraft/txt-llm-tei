            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p> I was very tired and very hurried this afternoon when I wrote. At Burgos where there are now over a thousand Basque soldiers I met a charming youth from Legorreta near Tolosa who told me that <foreign xml:lang="es">como te llamas tu</foreign> is <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">nola deitzen zaik iri</hi>
               </foreign>: this <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">zaik</hi>
               </foreign> had been <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">zain</hi>
               </foreign> if a woman had been addressed. Speaking to a man <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">I dont know</hi> is <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
etzakiat</hi>
               </foreign> and to a woman <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">etzakiñat</hi>
               </foreign>. J. I. de Arana will have it that Basque <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
berde</hi>
               </foreign> does not derive from <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
viridis</hi> via Spanish but from bedar = herba and that <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">olloa</hi>
               </foreign> has nothing to do with <foreign xml:lang="es">pollo</foreign> but to translate it. He forgets the analogy of <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
otchoa</hi>
               </foreign> = the wolf and <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">potchoa</hi>
               </foreign> = the dog. At Santa Comba Dão where I slept last night I saw a beautiful dog born of a she-wolf by a St Bernard dog as I was told. At Burgos there is a promenade called Espolon. It made me think of Spoleto and Ezpoleta. At Salamanca I lodged in the fonda de la Bascongada kept by a Basque woman from <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">
Donostia</placeName>. The two youngest of the 8 boys now residing in this college speak English very well as they have had at their quinta 3 governesses to teach English of whom one was a German. I detest the German in their accent. The headmaster here seems very stupid – he was destined to the priesthood and studied in the seminary here but has now a wife and one child. He was born at O Porto. Does the Portuguese arraia meaning a kind of fish come from Basque or is it from the same source as the English ray. But you never answer my questions. I hope to draw up a list of Portuguese place names of Basque origin. I feel like a fish out of water.</p>
