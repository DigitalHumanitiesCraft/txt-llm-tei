            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Schuchardt</opener>
            <p>are you dead, ill, or in a bad temper with me? I should much regret an affirmative answer to any of these questions – But you have not sent me a single line since I left <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">San Sebastian</placeName>. I have just received a postcard from <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName>, who offers to revise my proofs for the new edition of Capanaga, which I am printing here at my own cost: 500 copies, which will be sold at one franc each. The printer insists on being paid for each set of 16 pages, and the total cost is 250 francs.

I do not lose much financially, but he accepts my offer to return 150 francs out of the 200 paid to me for the journey and so I am in a financial difficulty as serious as ever – my Capanaga will cost me 250 francs, a sacrifice to science. Can you lend me anything? No 76. d. in <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
