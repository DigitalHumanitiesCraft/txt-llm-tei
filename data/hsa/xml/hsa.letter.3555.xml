            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>best thanks for your card &amp; the letter of the Secretary of your Academy, rather too flattering for me, which came in a registered letter this morning. After taking the unnecessary precaution of registering it, you might ]I[ think [I] have put more than a dozen words of your own it [sic] it, as they are never wasted on me. I sent back to Madrid this morning the last set of proofs, rather the proofs for the last section, of my inscriptions. They will appear in March, I believe. The work embraces 115 localities; and I have myself visited almost everyone of them which lies within the Basque region. It will consist of about 80 pages. It costs me at least 100 pesetas for the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">separatabdruck</hi>, which I shall therefore have to sell as far as possible. Judging from my experience of Capanaga I shall have few purchasers indeed. I sold 10 of the last Leiçarraga dictionary, and gave away all the rest but my own copy. I have not visited all the Basque villages yet; but probably among the unknown ones I should find no inscriptions other than sepulcral. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Webster</persName> sent me his bit of D'Urtes Dictionary, with many misprints. I hope the rest will follow. As <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName> does not seem disposed to mark as mine all items in my 4<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> supplement (which I offered to let him embody in his, which is to appear soon) which he would otherwise have overlooked, it is possible that I shall not send it to him. I forwarded to him yesterday the Belloc Leiçarraga. </p>
