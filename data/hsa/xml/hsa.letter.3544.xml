            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>may I request you to do what you can to preserve the medieval frescoes in the passage of the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.718">University Buildings in Leipzig</ref> and also the Rathaus there with its Dutch gables? I have heard that they have been menaced. I love them as much as Eckerleins Keller, and in my medieval dreams they are among the pleasantest. I have been correcting proofs of my Basque Inscriptions since the beginning of July. As they are printed in Spain the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">delay</hi> is intelligible. I have 24 pages in type, and send to Madrid tonight enough manuscript for 24 more, and yet <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">plus ultra</hi>. I have been correcting proofs of my new Basque Verb-Dictionary since the month of May, &amp; sent the last back about a fortnight ago. I hope I shall soon be able to send you a copy. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Azkue</persName>s class has opened this season with <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">40</hi> members. They tell me the number will gradually diminish. He has abandoned his <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">dai</hi>, and pronounces da in the class. A youth from Mundaka assures me they really say there <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
nai</hi> for <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
naiz</hi>
               </foreign> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ai</hi> for <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">aiz</hi>; so perhaps he thought the 3<hi rendition="#sup">rd</hi> person might be inferred to be dai. I send you two of the papers he circulates in class &amp; a proofsheet. I have learnt much this summer, &amp; been in many Basque villages never before visited by me. <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">But you do not deserve to learn from me</hi>. I have acquired many newly published Basque books, and a few more precious old ones.<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">Fortsetzung am rechten Rand.</note> You have not kept your promise about <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.742">
Georgian</ref>.<note n="2" place="foot" type="editorial">Fortsetzung kopfüber am oberen Rand.</note> I shall go back to Bayonne very soon &amp; probably spend the winter at <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Pau</placeName> &amp; Biarritz. </p>
