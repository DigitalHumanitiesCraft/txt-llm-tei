            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>your friend D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Joaquim de Vasconcellos</persName>, whom you never met but who called on me at OPorto, has suggested that I should spend some days at Vizella while he and his wife are taking the waters there. I expect to arrive there on the 10<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>, and to make the acquaintance of and learn something from the Freiburg doctoress as well as her husband. I had introductions to them from other people as well as yourself. I find that in <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Joaquin Leizarragas</persName> Coplac about Jesus, printed by the Prince, beçala and its cases are invariably left without cedilla. Otherwise I think it contains only 3 misprints. The authors habit of leaving out the first part of some words is peculiar. Just after I posted my letter from Espinho, containing my translation of your article on the catalogue, it occurred to me that I had written Gallego instead of Galizian. I have just returned from a stay of 16 days in Galizia. By coach from Santiago (where I saw the Codex Calixtinus and its Basque words correctly printed by Fita) to Noya, thence on horseback by the new road to La Puebla, thence by steamer to Villagarcia, thence by coach to Pontevedra, thence by tramway to Marin &amp; back &amp; on by train to Vigo, whence by coach to Bayona, which may well be either from <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Bai ona</hi> or from <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Ibai ona</hi>, as there the splendid bay is formed by a good river. Was old <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Baiae</hi> baptised by Basques? Thence I walked on to La Guardia &amp; Pasaje opposite Caminha, where I slept last night: OYA between Bayona &amp; La Guardia is a bedlike cove with a bedlike village shut in by a semicircle of mountains behind it &amp; full of peaceful &amp; rich beds of vegetables. </p>
