            <opener>Dear Sir,</opener>
            <p>Since the receipt of your letter of the 29th October last I have been enquiring for the books you are in need of, but I have not been able to find out anyone who has them. I shall make further inquiries and shall let you know if my work turns out to be successful. The only publications I am able to send you are nos 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Bruffador 1888. This paper was discontinued last year. I am not myself acquainted with the Portuguese language, either the genuine or the Ceylon, but Rev P Willenberg, the Editor of the Bruffador, tells me that of the words you mention the following are the correct <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/> forms: “mintira” “cuidade”, “hoje”, “venca”, bate”, “persuade, “cumsa”, “torna”. I enclose 4 verses of a song with transliteration which I think will be intelligible.</p>
            <p>P Willenberg tells me that M Moscof, European Wesleyan Missionary, has a copy of W B Fox’s Dictionary in Sinhalese, Portuguese and English languages and has promised to try his best to get you the loan of it. I will let you know the result as soon as it is communicated to me.</p>

               <p>P.S. </p>
               <p>About dialectical differences I shall write in my next or in the Orientalist.</p>
               <p>The influence of the Sinhalese and <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.3386">Tamil</ref> on the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.180">Ceylon Portuguese</ref> is very palpable, not I think in phonetics, but in forms of syntax. I have written a notice of one of these for the next “Orientalist” Parts 3 &amp; 4 of Vol. iv.</p>
               <p>I shall reply to your other queries in my next.</p>
