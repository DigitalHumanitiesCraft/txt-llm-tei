            <dateline>Kertch, 16 September 1895,</dateline>
            <opener>Dear Sir,</opener>
            <p>My last letter crossed yours, so I have two of yours to answer.</p>
            <p>Will you please send me a copy of the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.3125">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Literarische Centralblatt</hi>
               </ref> containing a notice of my sister’s <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Folk Tales</hi>? Mr. Quaritch, of 15 Piccadilly, is now printing for her a verse translation of „The Hermit“ by Ilia Chavchavadze, which will be ready in about six weeks.<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">

                  </bibl> - Autograph of Marjory Wardrop on “The Hermit” is preserved in the Oxford University. It is framed in the expensive whitish suede frame which has Marjory Wardrop’s handmade sawing on it with pink threads saying “The Hermit” and her initials “M.W.”. On the front page the writing says: “Dedicated to Oliver Wardrop from her loving sister Marjory Wardrop. Kerchi, October 10, 1895” (see details in “<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">The Treasury of the Happiness and the Virtue</hi>” by Guram Sharadze, Tbilisi, 1984, page 340).</note>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot understand why the people of <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Tiflis</placeName> do not reply to your letters. It is probably due to the fact <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/> that everybody is out of town. They are not so stupid as to feel offended that you omitted the title of ,Prince‘, which has become ridiculous in the eyes of most of them.</p>
            <p>Thanks for pointing out the blunder in my translation of Tsagareli’s catalogue.<note n="2" place="foot" type="editorial">

            <p>I had sent my translation of the first part of Dodashvili’s sketch to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Conybeare</persName>
               <note n="4" place="foot" type="editorial">

I am therefore sending the article to Professor Friedrich Müller, and hope he will print it. The first part was published in „Moambe“ N°. 4, 1894; the second part (Moambe N°. 6 1894) consists almost entirely of paradigms etc. so I have thought it better to refer students to the original.</p>
