            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>
               <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">El Cantabro</hi> of Tolosa has recommended its readers to buy my Capanaga, which is on sale there in Mugerzas bookshop. Other copies are on sale chez <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.3296">

Boyveau</ref> at Paris, Moquet at Bordeaux, Jérome at Bayonne, Elosu at Durango, and I have sent 10 to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Marcelino Soroa Lasa</persName>, who is become a teatotaller, as he expressed his willingness and his power to print a critique on the book in <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">La Union Vascongada</hi> and suggested that the place of sale should be mentioned. I have over 200 copies on sale here. on page 84 read norçuc in the first line. p. 153 read çauçu and çuec. on p. CLXV read ”y <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">segundo</hi> libro bascongado impreso” (Else was first mentioned by Nicolas Antonio whom <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Vinson</persName> speaks of on page 26 but omits in his <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Tables</hi>). on p. CLXXVI read 466 instead of 500 and on p. CLXXIX read, line 8, ”the other the last two letters of the first line, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">it</hi>.” At Luso on the last night of the old year they had a tragedy and a tragi-comedy in the popular theatre by local amateurs who wrote the plays for the occasion. I distinctly heard ”muinto <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">bai</hi>” for muito <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">bem</hi> and “<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">tambai</hi>” for <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">tambem</hi>. I find that the people in Portugal often make a slight sound of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">n</hi> at the end of mui without the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">to</hi> – muin frio for instance. My causing about a dozen basque books to be inscribed in the catalogue of the University Library yesterday evoked all the imbecility of the sub-librarian. I gave them the first 32 pages of your recent Academical Baskische studien, and promised to ask you to send the rest of the work. I have just read Bréals article in a recent number of the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.4980">

               </ref>. What connection is there between <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">incontinent</hi> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">contant</hi> except that both express rapidity of action? &amp; what connection between <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">exaucer</hi> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
exhausser</hi>? unless it be the idea that to hear a prayer is to elevate the person who prays? I arrived here on the first of January. If I do not get any pupils I shall probably spend February in Algarve. There is no English teacher of English here. The <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5757">

               </ref> has not yet begun to fulfil its promise about Duvoisins Bible. I suspect that his literary heir Hariztoy opposes it as he does not like the Bible for popular reading. Pallioppis Dictionary is very incomplete. Is the Rumontch for man from latin Christiano? </p>
