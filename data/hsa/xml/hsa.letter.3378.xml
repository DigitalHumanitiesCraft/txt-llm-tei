            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>the Rev<hi rendition="#sup">d</hi>. J. I. de Arana says the same thing as you about <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">nachaco</hi> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">nachacho</hi> in Capanaga. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">De Charencey</persName> has not yet sent back <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> autograph copy of the 2<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi> part of the work, (But I am convinced there are still some errors in that, though I sent it back to the author for revision), neither will <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> lend me the original. So I expect my 2<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi> part will be much less perfect than the first. They promise me the whole will be ready by the 15<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> of December but I dont much trust them. An index of the 500 forms of the verb in Capanaga will be thrown in. I hope that <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.4157">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">the Academy</hi>
               </ref> of tonight will contain my article on the language of Capanaga – I might easily have made it longer, but feared that that would lead to its exclusion. Till you prove the contrary, I shall consider that I have found the key to <foreign xml:lang="pt">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
leilão</hi>
               </foreign> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ne-</hi>ska. Do you think Portuguese <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
                  <foreign xml:lang="pt">
Loiça</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="es">Toda a especie de vasos de barro</foreign>
               </hi>, is from Basque <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">loi</hi>
               </foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">lohi</hi>
               </foreign> = mud, whence the place named <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Lohizun</hi> = muddy, marshy, and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Loyo</hi>la = mud-workshop, or tuilerie? I know you will say ”no”, just to dishearten me! Do you think <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Urbion</hi> the name of the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
serra</hi> where de <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/> Douro has its <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ur</hi>-<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">begi</hi> may be a Basque word? Do you think the river name UL in Portugal may be the Basque UR which often is used for river? or that <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Isna</hi> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Sever</hi> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Liz</hi>, and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Lena</hi> (as I have often thought <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Lena</hi> in Siberia might be), and Arnoia (cf: Arno in Tuscany) &amp; Arda, and Asseca (at Tavíra) and Sabor may be of Basque origin? or that of the rivers Vascão and Neiva? You will see that I have been studying the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Chorographia de Portugal</hi> (Guillard, Ailland &amp; C<hi rendition="#sup">ia</hi> Lisboa 242 Rua Aurea) published a few months ago. It contains an article entitled ”Portugal Glottologico” by <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Leite de Vasconcellos</persName> and a ”carta dialectologica do Continente Portugues” also by him, which he claims to be the first of its kind. I should much like to go and study on the spots the dialects of Tras Os Montes which he mentions as specially important ”Mirandes, Riodonores, Guadramiles”. I find there is a town of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Leiria</hi> in Portugal[,] that <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">dolmens</hi> are called <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">anta</hi> which recalls <pb facs="#IMG.3" n="3"/>
               <persName ref="[authorityLink]">De Charencey</persName>s suggestive attempt to connect <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">antae</hi> in Latin with Basque <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
ate</hi>
               </foreign> = door, gate. The highest range of hills in the kingdom is that called <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Larouco</hi>, on the frontier of Galicia, which I derive from Basque <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">larre</hi>
               </foreign>. Another place in Portugal, among many others, which looks like Basque is <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Ougela</hi>. I must tell you that I have not yet found an <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
educated</hi> Portuguese who has observed the phenomenon of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Bai</hi>, for <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">yes</hi> in general, and not a way of pronouncing <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">vae</hi> = he or she or it <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">goes</hi>. But those people with whom I have spoken are not philological observers. One however told me I was quite right in affirming its existence in the province of Orense. Another Basque-looking mountain name in Portugal is <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Oural</hi> on the banks of the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Lenia</hi>, which I think I told you is in the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Bai</hi> region and may well be of Basque origin signifying <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">mud</hi>. I saw somewhere that the Ural <pb facs="#IMG.4" n="4"/> river and mountains between Asia and Europe derive their name from a Turkish word meaning <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">girdle</hi>. Is not this like Basque <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ugala</hi>
               </foreign> with the same meaning? compare <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">urarte</hi> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ugarte</hi>. Luzin is a mountain in Portugal which I should like to sweep into the catalogue of Euskarian nomenclature. They promise me my Capanaga for Dec: 15<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi>. I don’t believe them. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">De Charencey</persName> and <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Linschmann</persName> have bought 10 copies each in advance – <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.3296">Quaritch</ref> sent me his Bonaparte Catalogue of the 9<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> but it was detained in Paris, and only reached me two days ago. How like Portuguese <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">cerebrino</hi> is to Shakesperes <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Brainish</hi> in Hamlet!</p>
            <p>“<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Ourreta</hi> é um valle de pastagens ou cultura entre terras ladeirentas” have we not here yet another Portuguese borrowing from Basque, very like <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">viura</hi> = valley? What do you say about the verb in this sentence of Capanaga <foreign xml:lang="eu">Ea emonbaga edugui daben bear eguin <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
deusaneen</hi> aloguera, edo salarioa where the Spanish is “Si ha tenido el jornal, o salario de los criados</foreign>.”? <pb facs="#IMG.5" n="5"/> it cannot be the equivalent, as Arana says, of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
deuseen</hi> for that is used (and only once) by Capanaga thus “<foreign xml:lang="eu">Ea semeai eta criaduai iracasten deuseen dotrinea eta costumbre onac” where the Spanish has ”si enseñan a los hijos y criados dotrina y buenas costumbres</foreign>” – I cannot see the way to identifying Capanagas use of these two forms, nor can I see yet what is the parsing of <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">deusaneen</hi>
               </foreign>. I expect you will have a keener vision. Aizkibel says that <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">errepira</hi>
               </foreign> means <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">valley</hi>. It is in the hymn about S<hi rendition="#sup">t</hi>. Ignatius of which I sent you a copy in the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Union Vascongada</hi>. You know what Aizkibel says about <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Dirauztazu</hi>
               </foreign>, it is not applicable to the use made of it by Dechepare – nor to its occurrence in the first Basque <pb facs="#IMG.6" n="6"/> letter (1584), of which they omitted one line in my edition in the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Union Vascongada</hi> last August. How do you translate and parse the word both in Dechepare and the letter? can it mean in the latter “represent me to yourself as giving the horses their food, or as taking care of the horses” or “the man or them making me take care of the horses”. a Basque told me he thought it might mean ”the horse or the horses make me think” “give me matter for reflection.” Arana says there were Basque catechisms printed at Pamplona before Capanaga. I dont much believe Martinez who told me Aizpitarte had written books in Guipuzcoan which had been printed. <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.4157">The Academy</ref> printed my letter wrongly making it look as if I thought ”Martinez the publisher” was ”<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">the</hi> publisher” of these books. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Linschmann</persName> says my contributions to Euskara 14 arrived too late.</p>
