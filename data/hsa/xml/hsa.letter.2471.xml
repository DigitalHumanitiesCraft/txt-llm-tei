            <opener>Dear Doctor</opener>
            <p>I do not expect to leave Innsbruck before Wednesday next and then shall probably go to Bavaria in order to see the passion play at O. A. on the Sunday following. perhaps I might then return to the place where you will then be, as I entertain a project of visiting Montenegro, Albania, and the western iles and coasts of Greece during the last 3 months of this year chiefly for linguistic purposes. I have begun your article in Kuhns Zeitschrift for 1872 on Albanian, and I find in Maisonneuves newest catalogue a good many works in or on that language. Do you think the word so widely spread in the Balkan peninsula under various forms Băltă, marais, marécage allied to the Basque word of the same meaning and nearly the same form, I think balsa or balza? There is a river <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ibar</hi> or <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">eibar</hi> in Montenegro - I see you make the Albanians to have borrowed sagmarius as the Basques have in zamari. Unfortunately I do not speak or even always read German easily - I hope your next card will be in Italian. I am reading the good old inverted prose of Boccaccio at present - a celebrated Maori chief bears a name of the same meaning big or ugly mouth Waha nui. M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>

It has been raining all the week except last evening &amp; this morning.
