            <opener>Dear Sir,</opener>
            <p>I was glad to get your card some days ago here in Sassari, which the peasants still call by its ancient name of Tatari. I have visited many villages &amp; the Cathedral cities of Tempio &amp; Castel Sardo on feet since landing in the iland on the morning of April 26, but I have been by rail over the bits between Terranova and Calangianus &amp; between Porto Torres &amp; this capital. Of course I find in the University Library many books of interest about the antiquities &amp; the language of the Sards. I send you today a corrected copy of my last venture in print. Please criticise it without mercy. I have several hundreds of the incorrect copy to be sold, I hope, this autumn in <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">
Basqueland</placeName>. Shall I meet you there? I might perhaps give up my wanderings if I coud find a nice Basque wife But on my present income I can neither marry nor travel with much comfort - Yet how much one learns in moving about and especially on foot! and how nice it would be to have children chattering in good <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Euskara</ref>! Several facts in this iland contribute to confirm me in my etymology of latin <foreign xml:lang="la">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">turris</hi>
               </foreign> Greek <foreign xml:lang="el">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">τυρρις</hi>
               </foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="el">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">τυρσις</hi>
               </foreign> from <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref>
               <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">iturri</hi>
               </foreign> - E. g. the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">runaghe</hi> as they call them in the north were towers &amp; are all near a fountain or a river (in africa there is at least one river called <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ituri)</hi> &amp; so are the villages which have <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">turris, turri, torre, torres</hi> as their name.</p>
