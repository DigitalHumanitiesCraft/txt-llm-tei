            <opener>To D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Hugo Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>your excommunication received this morning surprises me little. I have long since seen that you are no friend of mine, though willing to use me as a cats paw or to get any advantage out of me that might be possible to you. My conscience tells me that I have tried to do my duty to the Basque language and to you in connection with it. Henceforth get your Basque books &amp; information from others. You say that you asked me to state my grounds for thinking a facsimile edition of Leiçarraga inadmissible. <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">I</hi>
               <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">never received any request of the sort from you</hi>. When you announced that you meant to include the misprints, which I have studied at intervals, (when in presence of the original that is, since the autumn of 1889) you did <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">not </hi>say that the edition was to be in <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">facsimile</hi>. If it <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">is</hi> your intention <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">really </hi>to produce a true <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
facsimile</hi>, a quasi-photographical likeness of the original typography <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">as a whole</hi>, I do <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">not complain </hi>any longer. But otherwise, in the case of a book having some 30 copies of its first edition to disseminate doubt and error in the midst of its otherwise unrivalled beauty, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">a 2<hi rendition="#sup">nd</hi> edition ought to be of the nature of a rectification</hi>. I think it quite possible that, in spite of your being older than I am &amp; having a longer experience of scientific publications, I might detect more misprints than yourself and M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">T. Linschmann</persName>. Professor <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Rhys</persName> thinks you very <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">conceited</hi>. It is a word often used stupidly &amp; has been applied to myself. For your <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">anmassung</hi> and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
unverschämtheit</hi> I care little. For Leiçarraga I care much. I have asked 3 Irish professors to send you notes on <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.901">Gaelic</ref> words used by anglers. Calm yourself &amp; study <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5677">Leiçarraga</ref>! </p>
