            <opener>My dear Sir</opener>
            <p>It was during a very busy time of our Midland Assizes, that your letter reached my hand. Since then I went travelling down to the South of the Island, and your letter went quite out of mind. But I have been overhauling all my papers and cannot think what has become of it. However, I will no longer delay writing to you, especially as I have just received your reminder by way of a post card. I was very much interested in your pamphlets, for altho’ I do not know <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.667">German</ref>, the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.844">Portuguese</ref> extracts were quite comprehensible. Those given in your last no. (no. VI) the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.163">Mangalore Portuguese</ref> were specially interesting. The language spoken there has a stronger affinity it seems to the Ceylon Portuguese, than the language spoken elsewhere. It seems to me that the specimens of lyrical poetry given in no. VI must have been copied out by a very illiterate man. He generally drops the final vowels, and in one of the lyrical pieces (IV p.9) an expletive (<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ai</hi>) is introduced at the commencement of each verse, which not only does not add anything to the meaning, but, destroyed the rhythm as I think. I will by and by give you a specimen of the same song as sung in <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Ceylon</placeName>. You will have to remember that the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.180">
Indo-Portuguese of Ceylon</ref> is (so far as I am aware) not taught in any of the schools of Ceylon. Those who were earliest in the field as Educators were the Missionaries, and amongst these, ever since I have known them the popular belief has been that the patois spoken in Ceylon was not worth perpetuating, that it was not worth improving, be<pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/>cause it was a corrupt dialect, and that in the course of a few generations, the mongrel dialect would die out. I am now over half a century old, but I do not find that these vaticinations have come to pass. The Portuguese language is as vigorous today as it were in the days of my youth, and is just as extensively used by the labouring classes (called in Ceylon by a strange anomaly, Mechanics), such as shoemakers, tailors, carpenters, tinkerers. True it is that it has nothing like a literature of its own – nor is it likely that it would have one, when so many attempts have been made to frown it out of existence. Yet the tenacity with which the classes I have above indicated have stuck to the so-called patois, shows that there is more vitality in it than some folks have imagined. I do not at all believe that there is any immediate prospect of any body having to sing a funeral dirge over the grave of Ceylon Portuguese. I would like to guarantee its life for another half century at least. If the present race of labouring men and their children, were all of a sudden to die out then I think there would be some likelihood of Ceylon Portuguese becoming a thing of the past. The <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.891">English Language</ref> is no doubt making very rapid strides, and good many of the workmen of today speak it, though very imperfectly still, at least, better than their fathers did before them. Nevertheless, there is a large proportion of them, who do not speak the language at all, tho’ English has been the chief language of the country for so very many years past. I have been endeavouring, to carry on a religious work among these labouring classes, and have had some very striking cases of successful work among them. They are very tenacious of their language indeed. Tho’ I never studied the Portuguese language, but picked it up here and there during my boyhood’ years, I find <pb facs="#IMG.3" n="3"/>that I can express in this language, almost all I can express in the English language. A cossia verborum is all that one wants to make even this patois of Ceylon Portuguese, answer all the purposes that one can reasonably expect of any language. I have found it wonderfully flexible, and altho’ sometimes one cannot express his ideas while speaking in Portuguese, in as few words as he could in English – yet there is hardly any sentiment expressible in English, which cannot, tho’ in a more roundabout way, be expressed in Portuguese. You will see by the little books of Songs and Hymns I am sending you by this mail, how some of our English favourites have been made to reappear in a Portuguese dress. I cannot say whether you are conversant with our English Hymn books but if you are, you will find that the fifth of the English hymns, is preserved in the Portuguese translations. I shall mark the sources where the English hymns were taken – so that if they are at all accessible to you, you may compare for yourself the original with the translation. You will find that I have been endeavouring as much as possible, to rectify the loose spelling which is in vogue everywhere where the language is spoken and which is the result – the necessary result – of speaking and writing a language which is not taught in schools – nor as studied grammatically – nor has any literary standards of its own. I have tried therefore to assimilate the spelling as much as possible to that of the Continental Portuguese as given in Anthony Vieyra Transtagano’s Dictionary published in London in 1773. I am also indebted to his grammar for a few hints. I will just jot down a few particulars for you, which may be useful to you in the prosecution of your researches into the <pb facs="#IMG.4" n="4"/>varied dialects extant in reference to the Portuguese. In Ceylon Portuguese – there is but one article, the Definite, but it is indeclinable – having <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">o</hi>
               </foreign> for the singular, and <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">os</hi>
               </foreign> for the plural. The place of the indefinite which is supplied by <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">hum</hi>
               </foreign>, contraction of <foreign xml:lang="cpp">

                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Hum rainha, a</hi>

                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">O rainha</hi>

               </foreign>, the queens.</p>
            <p>Substantives, Adjectives and Pronouns, have no inflexions. Their different cases are formed not by terminal inflexions, but by the use of prepositions. They are declined thus.</p>

            <p>Very frequently in ordinary conversation, the singular <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">o</hi>
               </foreign> goes even with the plural form of the noun, as <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">o rainhas</hi>
               </foreign>. The general rule for the formation of the plural is by adding s to the singular. The only exception I can recall at this moment is <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Deos</hi>
               </foreign> God, which has <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
Deoses</hi>
               </foreign> for the plural.</p>
            <p>Adjectives. In respect of degrees of comparison, there is no inflection of the words. So far as I can remember, there are only two adjectives, whose comparatives end in <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">or</hi>
               </foreign>. These are <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
bom</hi>
               </foreign>, good, <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">melhor</hi>
               </foreign>, better, and <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">mal</hi>
               </foreign> bad, <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">peor</hi>
               </foreign>, worse. The only ‘word’ in which <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
mayor</hi>
               </foreign>, greater, comes in is Good Friday,<foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none"> Sesta-feira mayor</hi>

                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
maior</hi>
               </foreign>.</p>
            <p>In all other cases the comparative is formed by <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">mais</hi>
               </foreign> more and the superlative by <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">muito mais</hi>
               </foreign>, or <foreign xml:lang="cpp">

            </p>
            <p>In respect of pronouns, the change of case is effected in the same way as the change in nouns is effected, by the addition of the prepositions, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">de, per, com</hi>. Thus</p>

                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">

               </foreign> is joined invariably to <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">mesmo</hi>
               </foreign>. I cannot think of any instance in which it stands by itself e.g. <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">si mesmo</hi>
               </foreign>. <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Mesmo</hi>
               </foreign> is also frequently joined to personal pronouns also, as <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">eu mesmo</hi>, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">vos mesmo</hi>, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">elle mesmo, iste mesmo</hi>
               </foreign> etc. I myself, you yourself, he himself, this itself etc.</p>
            <p>In respect of possessive pronouns, <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">meu</hi>
               </foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">minha</hi>
               </foreign> are used convertibly, irrespective of gender. <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
Meu amor</hi>
               </foreign>, my love, <foreign xml:lang="cpp">

                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">teu, tua, seu, sua, vossa, nossa</hi>
               </foreign>, they are used irrespective of the gender of the noun, and are convertible. There are only two demonstrative pronouns, <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">iste</hi>
               </foreign>, and <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">aquel</hi>
               </foreign> – this and that. They are both indeclinable, and form their plural by adding s. Sometimes <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">aquel</hi>
               </foreign>, in the plural is <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
aquelles</hi>
               </foreign>, but this has gone out of use, and appears only in the older writings. <foreign xml:lang="cpp">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">

            <p>I think the foregoing will give you a tolerably fair idea, of what Ceylon Portuguese is like. I hardly need trouble you with any adverbs and prepositions. I omitted to mention that sometimes, instead of <foreign xml:lang="cpp">

               </foreign>

               </foreign>, let us love.</p>
            <p>I have put these grammatical notes together rather hurriedly and have no time to revise. Perhaps if I have leisure I may hereafter more carefully prepare an article for the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Orientalist</hi>, on the Indo-Portuguese of Ceylon, but that must steed more indefinitely.</p>
            <p>You will receive by this post, a Portuguese New Testament, the one I see you quote from of 1826, is out of print here, and out of use too. A very great friend of mine, and <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">quondam</hi> teacher was the translator of the New Testament I send you. He has used a great many words taken from the Continental Portuguese (called here High Portuguese, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Portugueza alto</hi>), which are not ordinarily in use; but this could hardly be avoided in a translation. Mr Blake was the name of the translator. He has now been dead some years. I will also try to send you, in addition to my little Hymn book, some manuscript songs. The song, commencing “<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Curre vi irmãos</hi>” is a total Abstinence song, composed by me for our Portuguese friends, and sung by me at one of their meetings to the wellknown and popular tune of “<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Margarita Maria, Margaritta, Margatitta Senhoras</hi>”. That is the air usually sung to your lyric piece (no. IV) in p. 9 of your pamphlet No. VI of the Mangalore Portuguese. I have jotted down the music for you. The other song I send you “<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Quem quer’ ovi</hi>”, has been written out for me, by a man here, who knows a good deal of the old songs. Any other information you may wish to get I shall be very glad to receive. Can you send me a complete set of your <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Kreolische Studien</hi>. I have parts, <bibl>
