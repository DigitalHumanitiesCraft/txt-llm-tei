            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Schuchardt,</opener>
            <p>I was much pleased to find a letter from you at the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.3096">Poste Restante</ref> here this morning - we have had in France an April without precedent in living memory, and I hope the weather has been equally aimiable on the north shore of Garda. I came on monday for a fortnight in the Yonne, and stayed an hour and three quarters at Melun on the way. In the museum of the Cathedral here they have the mitre and mass robes of S<hi rendition="#sup">t</hi> Thomas a Becket who lived at S<hi rendition="#sup">t</hi> Columbos convent just outside this metropolitical city for the three years before his assassination in Canterbury Cathedral: I went thither yesterday, but found the place occupied by a modern nunnery with however a beautiful new Gothic chapel by an architect of this place, in which three or four sculptured fragments of the medieval chapel are preserved. This is a nice place to be quite quiet in, though it is not depressing like some provincial towns - Some of the place names in the department look in their modern form like <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref> e. g. Yrouerre, Irancy, Beru<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">Heute: <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Bery</placeName>.</note>, Sarri<note n="2" place="foot" type="editorial">Heute: <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Sarry</placeName>.</note>, etc: etc: But the most Basque of French departments omitting those on the Spanish Frontier is, as I told you in 89, that of the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Aisne</hi>, where even the medieval forms look <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Euskarian</ref>. I have long urged the Basques to bring out a catena nova librorum Euskarorum vetustiorum - M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>

A few lines in Basque from you to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Inchauspe</persName> might encourage him to go on. M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>

I should like to see your article thereon. I have read or heard somewhere that <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">bai</hi>
               </foreign> is used in parts of Ireland to mean <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">yes</hi> as in Basque. I have long supposed Corcach to be Basque <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Kolkoak</hi> as it is on a large and much indented gulf or bay. an old Irish name for Connemara, or part of it, seems to me to contain the Basque element which would be suitable to that coast and to the lake-bosoms of its interior. I have hitherto attached Basque <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Ehun</hi>
               </foreign> to Gothic <foreign xml:lang="got">

pickings</hi>
               </foreign>” which we often use in the sense of “selections” of the best parts of anything as well as for the refuse left for the starving to pick up. You will be amused in a few days by my <bibl>“Helaine”</bibl> fragment in the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.3129">Revue de Linguistique</ref> if you see that publication.
