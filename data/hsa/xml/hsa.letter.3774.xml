            <opener> Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. H. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>I have not yet succeeded in getting Vinsons supplementary Bibliography though I saw a copy of it in Bayonne a fort night ago. In that I notice that <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName> describes your letter (in which you ignore all that I have done, rather tried to do, for Leiçarragà for the last ten years) published in <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
L'Avenir</hi> some months ago as a <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
réponse</hi> to that which I published in the number of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">4 Décembre</hi> 1897. That description is a lie, in Vinsons own style. <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">You complained</hi> to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName> in a letter, which he sent to Cork for my perusal, and to Miss <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Ferrar</persName> in another, which she sent to me also for perusal, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">that you had never seen my letter. I have already told you that I should have sent you the Avenir of Dec<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. 4</hi>, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
1897</hi>, had I received the packet containing ten copies which M<hi rendition="#sup">
r</hi> Arnaud Détroyat tells me was addressed to me at Cork. <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">I never received that packet</hi>. I afterwards received one copy, and felt it my duty to keep that as evidence. I have just been to the office of the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Avenir</hi> where they presented me with three copies of the number in question. I have sent one to you. They confirm M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Détroyats statement that a packet of ten was sent to Cork for me. You will see that Vinsons statement, on which you based your <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">answer</hi>, is incorrect.</p>
