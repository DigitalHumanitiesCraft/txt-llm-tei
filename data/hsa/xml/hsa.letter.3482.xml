            <opener>Dear Professor Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>Mr <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> is responsible if my edition of Capanaga is at fault in those parts where the text is taken from his copy, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">which he revised</hi>. More than this, he inspected my copy of the book after I had filled it in from his revised autograph copy. I have changed <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">artu</hi> into <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ortu = “huerto”</hi> because in the other place the text has ortu. I have sent my copy of the original to M<hi rendition="#sup">
r</hi>. A. D’Abbadie, with two copies of the new edition. He has not acknowledged it any more than the other things sent by me to him since September 1892. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> has never been very polite in his correspondences, nor very intelligent either, and now he expresses a whish to end it because he is ”disgusted at the incessant observations on everyone”. He is at liberty to publish all my correspondence if he likes. I have sent him one copy of my Capanaga. Half the edition of 466 copies is now disposed of, chiefly in gifts, &amp; partly in payment of debts instead of money. If you can promote the sale of the remaining 233 copies I shall be thankful. You promised to say something <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">beruhmend</hi> in my favour. On page 140 the original has <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">daguiçun</hi>. I left out the n on purpose but kept it in the index. As for egun guren on the top of 148 you must find out if you can from <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> what it means. I took it entirely on his authority after questioning it. Do you think <foreign xml:lang="pt">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">zaranza</hi>
               </foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="pt">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
homenzarrãs</hi>
               </foreign> in Portuguese are Basque words. At San Martin a village near here they say <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">bandera</hi> for <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">vendera</hi>. Saa de Miranda seems from a copy of his works in the Library of the Lycée here to have been a contemporary of the cardinal who was King of Portugal for 2 years. He wrote Qu’emendo muito, &amp; qu’emendando daño (os estrangeiros).</p>
