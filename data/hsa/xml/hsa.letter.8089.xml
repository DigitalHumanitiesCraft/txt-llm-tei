            <opener>My Dear Sir, </opener>
            <p>In continuation of my last letter<note n="2" place="foot" type="editorial">
                  <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.letter.8088">HSA 11585</ref>.</note> - I send per parcel post all my M.S.S, connected with my researches into corrupt English made in 1874-6 when stationed on duty at Madras &amp; in the Madras Residency.</p>
            <p>They are incomplete but contain a vast amount of M.S.S. in their way,</p>
            <p>You will find A a huge M.S.S. Dictionary of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
military</hi>
               <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/> terms illustrated by sentences. The language is the Hindustani of the army in the Dakhani or Madrási Dialect of it which is very different from the „correct“ Hindustani spoken in Northern India. I see I have written the words <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">only</hi> in the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Persian</hi> character but on examining the writing I find it to be clear and plainly (??) read. Many of the sentences are merely ,words of command‘ but they serve to indicate the direction corruptions will take. This Dictionary has a <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">complete index</hi> in the Persian Characters attached.</p>
            <p>You will also find attached <pb facs="#IMG.3" n="3"/> to it a rough M.S. showing the vocal changes English words have undergone in the mouths of our native soldiers or instances in the Dictionary. I guarantee <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
every</hi> sentence &amp; word recorded to be genuine in the whole work was done either by myself or under my immediate supervision. I send attached 7 small notebooks of Hindustani notes in the Persian Character partly translated &amp; partly not. – Those <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">not</hi> translated I fear my be looked on as lost: Some of them have been incorporated into my Dictionary &amp; where this has happened you will <pb facs="#IMG.4" n="4"/> find it noted.</p>
            <p>(B) You will find 8 notebooks containing vocabularies of English words and in <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.3386">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Tamil</hi>
               </ref>, partly translated &amp; partly not. The writing however is very clear &amp; easily read. They are of all sorts – press, shipping, law &amp; common words. My native servant Abraham listed (??) them &amp; M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Spring Branson<note n="3" place="foot" type="editorial">
                  <persName>
James Spring Branson</persName> (1842-1897), Advocate General of the Madras Presidency.</note> whom I could trust the rest.</p>
            <p>(C) You will find 3 note books of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
Telugu</hi>
               <note n="4" place="foot" type="editorial">Sprache aus der <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.3399">dravidischen</ref> Sprachfamilie Südindiens.</note> English words in the same way, very clearly written.</p>
            <pb facs="#IMG.5" n="5"/>
            <p>(D) I send other note books marked as incorporated in the big Dictionary.</p>
            <p>(E) I send rough indices marked as incorporated in the complete index.</p>
            <p>So that you have my complete M.S.S.</p>
            <p>If all this mass of material were dissected I think it would give a fair notion of the direction that verbal changes are taking in Madras in the process of the incorporation of English words into the native languages. In this way many pursuits could permit to help in this work.</p>
            <pb facs="#IMG.6" n="6"/>
            <p>As it is I must content myself with offering you any assistance I have time for – meanwhile you are at liberty to use my M.S.S. for your own works &amp; researches. There is but one condition I attach to sending these M.S.S. &amp; that is that they be carefully kept &amp; avancements be made for their return to my family when I should die before that period. They represent some of the hardest work I ever did &amp; though I do not look on them as fit for publication in their present state I still think they <pb facs="#IMG.7" n="7"/> are capable of forming the basis of a valuable book &amp; to set some store system. –</p>
            <p>For this reason I give my family address in England – which is care of Sir Richard Temple, Bart, The Nash, Kempsey, Worcester. Sir Richard, my father<note n="5" place="foot" type="editorial">Sir Richard Temple (1826-1902), britischer Politiker und Verwaltungsfachmann</note>, was Governor of Bombay &amp; before that of Bengal &amp; is a name you are perhaps familiar with. These M.S.S. are recorded in my will &amp; my Executers will communicate with you.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you may like to draw <pb facs="#IMG.8" n="8"/> attention to the M.S.S. – but that is a matter I leave to your judgement.</p>
            <p>Trusting that they will reach you in safety &amp; be of real use to you after ten years of lying on the shelf!</p>
