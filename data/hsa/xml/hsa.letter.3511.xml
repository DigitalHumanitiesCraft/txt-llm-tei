            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt</opener>
            <p>I recieved yesterday your postcard of the 3<hi rendition="#sup">rd</hi> You still leave me without your opinion on certain etymologies that I have suggested to you such as <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">aps, acheter</hi> etc: etc: Do you think Greek <foreign xml:lang="el">NAI</foreign> meaning yes is from Basque <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">nai</hi>
               </foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">nahi</hi>
               </foreign>? Assent is an act of the will. I believe I am right in saying that this Greek word is devoid of relatives in the other languages of the family, and may not the Pelasgi have been Basque? Mr. Suarez, sublibrarian of the University here has introduced me to this club, Ateneo Barcelones. I had the same privilege in 1888. It has a good library and the reading room is full of many reviews and newspapers in many <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/> languages. The University Library has Novia de Salcedos Dictionary of which the proofs were insufficiently corrected by Antia the late rector of Urnieta, but scarcely any other books on or in Basque. It has the Virgil of Venice 1470 by a German printer from Spires. I bought at Valencia the new edition of the earliest book printed there and probably in all Spain. I saw the original in the University there and sent you the prospectus. My German companion left me this day fortnight. He was to arrive in Paris last Sunday. He has much to learn. I owe him 400 pesetas. He will give me time. I lost about 200 francs at least over my edition of Capanaga, of which very few copies have been bought; <pb facs="#IMG.3" n="3"/> but I am now planning an edition of Rafael Micoleta a Bilbao priest of 1653. I have nearly finished my copy of his glossary and have quite finished that of his dialogues as published in the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Revista de Ciencias Historicas</hi> tomo 2. Barcelona 1881 which edition is full of blunders. I have asked Mr. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Thomas</persName> to revise my amended text in presence of the manuscript which is among the Spanish mss in the British Museum and mentioned by Paulus Merula in his Cosmographia printed by the Elzevirs. A copy of this book is on the catalogue of the University of Barcelona but the librarians cannot find it! J. I. Arana says he mentioned Micoleta long ago in his inedited Basque Bibliography. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName> says he has known of it depuis fort longtemps – Why <note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">
Randnotiz auf der rechten Seite: some of Micoletas words are not in Novia de Salcedos Lexikon.</note>
               <pb facs="#IMG.4" n="4"/> they [sic] does he not mention it or Colmenars books, which he also claims to have known, anywhere in his Bibliography? He does mention Arquiztain [sic], Bullet, Nicolas Antonio, &amp; Hervas – but not in their proper places, only incidentally and subordinately. He also omits articles of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName>, Sampere, &amp; Fitas supplement to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Larramendi</persName> also published in the 4 tomos of the aforesaid Revista. In respect of Ypuscoa and Guipuzcoa I am much interested by seeing in <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Morel Fatios</persName> recent article in the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.3095">
Romania</ref> that Isopete was once Guisopete. I have noted various cases of the falling away of initial g and b and v in Basque, like the F in Greek. in Micoleta there is <note n="2" place="foot" type="editorial">Randnotiz auf der linken Seite: 1894 ko urtea &amp; ur bezala urten da orai.</note>
               <pb facs="#IMG.5" n="5"/> varina for arina = light, in Voltaire, of which I have an edition that appears to be unknown, to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Vinson</persName> to whom I shall send it soon, there is bona for ona = good.</p>
            <p>Micoleta is very like Capanaga. but he has ja for <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">da &amp; ta</hi> the conjunction. I know no other author who writes so – also as a proof, (like Pouvreaus <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">dur</hi> = water &amp; river, &amp; Durango = on the other side of the river) of the common Keltic &amp; Basque origin of the word for <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">water &amp; year</hi> which means “the running out” or “flowing away like water”, urte is written by Micoleta durte. </p>
            <p>He also writes dustia &amp; <pb facs="#IMG.6" n="6"/> even deustria (cf: Gar]r[itaonandias hostria = hostia) for guztia, and damua for hamua though this last may be a misprint. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Vinson</persName> has not sent me any proof for my corrigenda to my article on Capanaga in the R. de L. As that <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Erratum</hi> was necessitated chiefly by the want of a proof for the article itself, it seems very foolish on his part to have sent none. I have always kept him au courant for my address, and I told him I had some important additions to make. Oh that I had known Micoleta in time! He and Araquiztain have taught me many things. A. teaches me that on p. 148 of my Capanaga the true <note n="3" place="foot" type="editorial">Randnotiz auf der linken Seite: I have often heard Spaniards say <foreign xml:lang="es">
                     <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">vaya</hi>
                  </foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="es">
                     <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">baya</hi>
                  </foreign> = “let him go.” in the sense of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">yes</hi>. Dont the French say <foreign xml:lang="fr">allez</foreign> in the same sense sometimes?</note>
               <pb facs="#IMG.7" n="7"/> reading is egun guren egunean. <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">I almost printed it so</hi>, as I guessed that <foreign xml:lang="eu">egun guren</foreign> must mean Holy Thursday, but no one answered my questions anent it. </p>
            <p>
               <foreign xml:lang="eu">Egüen guren eguna</foreign> is a variant according to Arakiztain. Many Biscayans call Thursday <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Egüen</hi>
               </foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Eguben</hi>
               </foreign>, even <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Egunben</hi>
               </foreign>, as in the Gernika tailors book which I sent you. I find in this little book also the justification of what I read in the original Capanaga where speaking of the gates of heaven as open he says <foreign xml:lang="eu">idigiac eta a zabalak</foreign>.</p>
            <p>As the original is badly <pb facs="#IMG.8" n="8"/> printed throughout and <foreign xml:lang="eu">etaazabalak</foreign> is written as one word I hesitated, but I thought all the time it might be the English idiom “open, and that, wide” = “open and widely so, i. e. widely open” – But having no precedent in my memory I laid it aside: - first thoughts were best: but the Gernika man has the same idiom somewhere – you will easily find it. I find a case of m final in my Voltoire dude<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">m</hi> beçala for <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">duden</hi>, as he writes <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
dudan</hi> several times. I also find there one case of the not unfrequent Labourdin usage of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ba</hi>, as a prefix, being equal to la the conjunctive suffix. In form it is the suppositive or hypothetic. As far as I remember it <note n="4" place="foot" type="editorial">Randnotiz auf der linken Seite: I long to go back to the Abalarien urarteak which I explored in 1886.</note>
               <pb facs="#IMG.9" n="9"/> only occurs after nahi nuke und so weiter – So that the underlying thought may be “I should desire (it) if you would take the measure for me” – But the French is “Je voudrois que me prînsiez la mesure.” In the following phrase Voltoire puts a cein which is really superfl]l[uous with the n in the verbal termination before egatik meaning for <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">those</hi> “<foreign xml:lang="eu">noiz ethorico naiz çure echera bors ehun escutu cein sor baiqueituçuenegatic</foreign>”? So also I find in D’Urte a case where <pb facs="#IMG.10" n="10"/>
               <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">nondik</hi>
               </foreign> = “par où, through which”, is superfluous as the meaning is expressed by the relative <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">n</hi> at the end of the verb. The Californiako Eskual Herria has published my two extracts from Lizarragas posthumous &amp; badly printed sermons &amp; another from the 1760 edition of Perochegi and also my translation of Dulce Domum &amp; of Lenz <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
Canaresfilchen</hi>. I think I told you that in <pb facs="#IMG.11" n="11"/> the latter instead of “<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">at the brightest light of the day</hi>” it ought to be “<foreign xml:lang="eu">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">argizaiten ordu dirdirantenaz</hi>
               </foreign>”. I had momentarily forgotten the meaning of licht in Luxembourgeois though I had it right in my notes “<foreign xml:lang="eu">din gura profesorului</foreign>” A boy at Anzuola seeing my pockets full of books said I was c<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">hit liburutsua</hi> very book-ful. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Marcelino Soroa y Lasa</persName>, whose new book I have not seen, writes interesting and amusing plays, but puts bad grammar into the mouth of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
all</hi> his <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">personae</hi> indiscriminately. I fear he <note n="5" place="foot" type="editorial">Randnotiz auf der linken Seite: one would expect I think a very with a partitive and relatival ending in <foreign xml:lang="eu">
                     <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">enik</hi>

               </note>
               <pb facs="#IMG.12" n="12"/> knows no better. Neither does he correct his proofs sufficiently. Several Spaniards say that ca cannot come from <foreign xml:lang="es">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">carájo</hi>
               </foreign>, as you propose. <foreign xml:lang="pt">Perco</foreign> in Portuguese is something like <foreign xml:lang="ca">crech</foreign> in Catalan – perdo – credo. The men in the provinces of Castellon &amp; Valencia wear as a headdress mokanesas like those of the French Basque girls, but with more of a pig-tail behind. <note n="6" place="foot" type="editorial">Randnotiz auf der rechten Seite: M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Courtney has returned my article on D’Urte as being too philological for the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Fortnightly Review</hi>.</note>
