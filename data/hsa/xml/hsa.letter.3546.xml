            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>I found on my return to Bilbao last evening from some villages in the valley of Arratia, where a very peculiar <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref> is spoken, your postcard and your book on <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.742">
Georgian</ref>. I thank you heartily for both. I found at the same time a lawyers letter from London saying that my father, aged about 84, died almost suddenly on the 11<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> of October, &amp; that I shall be a little richer from the beginning of the new year. <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">It is a great grief to me</hi>, as you may suppose. I have tried my best to bring about a reconciliation. I believe I remain the poorest of all my brothers. But being richer I shall be able henceforth to do more for my favourite Basque studies. I have been introduced for a month as an honorary member to the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Sociedad Bilbaina</hi> which has a very good library. I have just read <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">un gant</hi>, a French translation (Paris 1894) of Bjornsons play. The <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">gutun</hi>, as they call it in Biscaya, is worn, like a bag of relics, on the breast. You will have seen that it contains a bit of each of the four gospels. You know what Inchauspe has said about <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">guthun</hi> meaning a book of devotions. The Portuguese call such books <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">relicuarios</hi>. It is probable that I shall travel in Germany &amp; Switzerland &amp; Austria next year, to visit the Leiçarragas there. I hope I may reach Graz and be graciously received. I had a mental intuition of your meeting M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Linschmann</persName> during the summer. He &amp; <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> have ceased to write to me &amp; I have not received Euskara 17. I will try to send you very soon some new Basque booklets &amp; a longer letter.</p>
