            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt,</opener>
            <p>I had thought of writing to you today as the festival of linguists brought you before my mind. Would that we coud all learn languages as easily as the Apostles did in the upper Chamber of Jerusalem! Do you believe that “there is any Holy Ghost” capable of enlightening our minds and endowing our tongues? - The Old Testament, in Genesis, makes the old serpent (the devil is <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">dracul</hi> in Roumanian) speak to Eve - what was the language of Satan? - perhaps philologists of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinsons</persName> school coud tell us! The New Testament sends tongues of flame upon the heads of Christs Apostles - Can any philologist tell us how many were the languages there spoken in the Pentecostal Chamber? I feel sure that <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref> was of the number - Oh if the Apostles had kept a phonograph! All the inscriptions and old manuscripts fail to give us the pronunciation of the words as used by the tongue. M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Gaidoz</persName> told us on Saturday in his class which consists of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Ferdinand Lot</persName>, the abbé Cadic a Breton (who tells me that <foreign xml:lang="br">

               </ref> will contain an improved edition of my catalogue of omissions, to which you so kindly refer in a note. I shall add, with a mention of your article, Raymonds book. I think I noticed the omission of that when I was at Bayonne last August, but forgot it afterwards. I had a talk for about an hour with M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">D’Abbadie</persName> at his house this evening - though usually avoiding <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.3129">Vinsons Revue</ref> he bought the last number containing my <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Helaine</hi>. If you can do anything more to help me against the world, and alas “domestici” mei, I shall be thankful. How can I study when at every moment I feel like the man with his head in the hole of the Guillotine, when my future prevents my profiting by the present? <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Priebsch</persName> goes to England on the 15<hi rendition="#sup">th</hi> and will write to you thence. I have advised him to stay longer in Oxford than in London. He is I fear a worldling, <note n="2" place="foot" type="editorial">Randnotiz auf der linken Seite: I see you have noticed several other points which I had also noted as defects.

What have you gained about <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref> from your colleagues in the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.3398">Academy at Vienna</ref>?

               <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Stempf</persName> has been in <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Paris</placeName> again since Thursday. I have seen him and quarrelled!

               <pb facs="#IMG.5" n="5"/> I think of leaving for Bayonne on the 8<hi rendition="#sup">

The Assyrian inscriptions, and the non Aryan inscriptions of Armenia itself show us some ancient place-names in Armenia which have at least every appearance of being <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref> e.g. <foreign xml:lang="eu">urarte, nairi, arran, Azkenaz, Araxes</foreign> - <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Armentia</hi> a mountain range in Basqueland at once suggests Armendia and as the Haiks or Armenians say that the name Armenia was applied to their contry by a <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">different race</hi> of people, their own name being Haiastan why should not both names <pb facs="#IMG.6" n="6"/> be Iberian for extension de montañas as I said to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Oregui</persName> in 87 before seeing the same explanation in <persName>Guisasolas</persName> writings later on? <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Yztueta</persName> and <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
                  <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Andres de Poça</hi>
               </persName> whose Basque words and etymologies, (<bibl>Bilbao 1597</bibl>) are most interesting and often correct, both make the Basques come from <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">

I am tired myself and shall be wearying you, so I will close my letter by assuring you how much I esteem all I have read from your pen, &amp; how much I desire your friendship to promote my material welfare in this <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">nigaristan</hi> as a writer in “the<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none"> 19<hi rendition="#sup">th </hi>Century</hi>” of 1891 calls hell - is it a Basque word with an Iranic termination? Let me know if you wish any special observations made during my next tour in Basqueland. I hope to visit Roncal and Aezkoa. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
