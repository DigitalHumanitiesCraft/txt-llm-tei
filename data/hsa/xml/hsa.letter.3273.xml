            <opener>Dear Sir,</opener>
            <p>on reading over your letter again I feel that perhaps I took it too seriously. I am the last to wish to quarrel with you and I desire your criticisms but I am full of worries and must ask you to be more considerate. A Roman history says that the Iberes of Spain &amp; Colchis spoke different languages but a foraner would say the same of the Souletins and the Basques nowadays. The Romans &amp; Greeks were not good observers of linguistic phenomena. The historian Sokrates says these two sets of Iberes were of the same race and I believe him. I left my Ms of Timothy chez <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Bréal</persName> and await his answer – will you accept its dedication if he accepts it? Do you want my Concordance to S<hi rendition="#sup">t</hi> John? Will you in return send me your Academic work on the verb? I told you at Munich how I wished for a pan-homo-phonic dictionary to shew how many senses the sounds made by all human throats can bear – we shall not live so long.</p>
