            <opener>Dear Prof<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Schuchardt</opener>
            <p>I am engaged in compiling a great dictionary of Americanisms<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">

The latter he takes to be a secret French based language of the voodoo culture (cf. <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.letter.3852">
Briefnummer 6369</ref>).</note>. Will you in your kindness suggest any other “lingo” not included in these. I have just received Das Ausland <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/> 28 July 1884 containing an interesting amount of the Schetimasha Indians and their jargon<note n="3" place="foot" type="editorial">Refers to <bibl>

My <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">American</hi> English work will be something remarkable, for I was born unto it, and familiarized myself with it from my childhood up, so that 30 years ago a friend said I was the greatest <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Slangist</hi> in America. I shall include a great deal of folklore negro songs &amp;c in the book and I have now 1.100 proverbs and similes. I have written to my friend Dr <pb facs="#IMG.3" n="3"/> Brinton<note n="4" place="foot" type="editorial">Leland is likely referring to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Daniel Garrison Brinton</persName> (1837-1899), an American physician, ethnologist, archeologist and linguist who specialized in Native American languages and culture and was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania at the time (<bibl>

            <p>Is there anything for which you could supply a contribution? I cant<note n="5" place="foot" type="editorial">Sic.</note> pay very high – not more than £ 5.- but then I only expect £ 5 worth, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">ie</hi> a short article on the subject with as much of a vocabulary as your generosity will grant.</p>
            <p>Our great English Slang Dictionary is progressing. It will be 6 or 7 times more copious than that of Hotten<note n="6" place="foot" type="editorial">

The East End of London was known to be Jewish (<bibl>

                  </bibl>). In these circumstances it appears unsurprising that language contact phenomena may have been apparent, although we are not aware of studies or publications on this issue. Modern Yiddish itself is a contact language, combining Hebrew and Armenic, Germanic and Slavonic elements (<bibl>
