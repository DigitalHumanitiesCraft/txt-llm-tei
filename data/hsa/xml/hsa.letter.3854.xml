            <opener>Lieber Herr Professor,</opener>
            <p>Ich gratuliere Ihnen dass Sie in Bologna<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">The University of <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">
Bologna</placeName> celebrated the 800th anniversary in June, 1888 (<bibl>

            <p>On the other hand I am very sorry that you suffered from Neurasthenie I don’t know what the devil it is but it sounds very terrible. Which reminds me of something which actually occurred when I was in Philadelphia few years ago. A friend of mine called on a friend of hers who was suffering from – well call it Meningitis or Dryanda cordifolia or anything Latin for a disorder. There came to <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/> the door a ‘coloured’ or black woman. How is your mistress, and what is the matter with her? Asked the visitor “Deed Ma’am I don’ know was the reply “but I’se ‘fraid it’s something very bad, for the Doctor has given it a very long geographical name”.</p>
            <p>First of all I must apologize that I did not explain clearly to you what I wanted. My work is to be a Dictionary of Americanisms<note n="2" place="foot" type="editorial">

Barrère/ Leland (1889)</ref>
                  </bibl>.</note> – of slang of course. But I give it a very wide scope. I intend that it shall include some account of Creole and Canadian French, Chinook, Gumbo, Pennsylvania ‘Dutch’ &amp;c. a short account of the character of each, with a brief <pb facs="#IMG.3" n="3"/> vocabulary. Also a rather wide and loose range as regards everything American, exem. g. folklore, specimens of negro songs. American Dishes, Proverbs, Sayings &amp; similes. Voodooism, political terms, fauna et flora. Now if you can write anything for me I shall gladly accept it. As regards the honorarium I merely stated what would be the average amount given by London reviewers for a short article, but if you can give more why just do as you like and put your own price only state what it will be, so that I may accord with my publisher, and arrange accordingly. Only be so kind if you can contribute anything let me know at once so that <pb facs="#IMG.4" n="4"/> I may announce your name in the list of those who will contribute, as the publisher wishes to be able to announce it at once.</p>
            <p>I received the day before yesterday from Dr. Oliver W. Holmes<note n="3" place="foot" type="editorial">It remains unclear if Leland is referring to <persName>

Oliver W. Holmes Jr</persName>. or <persName>

Sr</persName>. The latter (1809-1894) appears more likely, as the father was a scholar and author as well as a physician while the son was a famous judge (<bibl>

                  </bibl>).</note> a very nice little paper on the Massachusetts dialect, with some interesting notes on local superstitions, and a list of words. Dr. D. G. Brinton<note n="4" place="foot" type="editorial">Leland is likely referring to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Daniel Garrison Brinton</persName> (1837-1899), an American physician, ethnologist, archeologist and linguist who specialized in Native American languages and culture and was a professor at the 
University of Pennsylvania at the time (<bibl>

I have written to Mr. Cable<note n="5" place="foot" type="editorial">Refers to <persName ref="[authorityLink]">George Washington Cable</persName> (1844-1925), a contemporary author from <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Louisiana</placeName> whose characters use <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.349">Louisiana Créole</ref>. He tried to promote French and creole language and culture in Louisiana (cf. <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.letter.3860">
Briefnummer 1483</ref>).</note> to help me in Creole French or Gumbo, which he understands. Gumbo is really an African patois, spoken in Louisiana and so on to Central America. In haste</p>
