            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>I shall send you tonight or tomorrow two numbers of <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">L'Avenir</hi> (de Bayonne) in which you are spoken of by me, and 1 by a Gascon who remains unknown. You will see the disastrous results of your most unkind neglect to say a word in favour either of my Capanaga or my Leiçarraga works. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Van Eys</persName> has written me a very unaimiable letter signifying that I had better not call on him if I go to San Remo. As I owed my first knowledge of Basque to him, Jan: 1886, though I had bought some 6 or 7 years before some of the gospels in Basque published by the Bible Society, out of curiosity, I naturally wished to make his acquaintance. You said you found him <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">sehr liebenswurdig.</hi> Many of his letters to me have seemed so also, and he has made me some handsome presents; and my letters to him would shew not servility but respect, only bounded by higher respect for scientific truth. Quite lately I put a complimentary notice of his projected edition of the proverbs in the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
Noticiers</hi>
               <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Bilbains</hi>. Has the book been published or not? <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Vinson</persName> also has been very disagreeable &amp; selfseeking. On the whole my Bascological experiences have not been agreeable. I have to pay 100 pesetas for as many copies of my <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">inscriptions</hi>
               <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Basques</hi>. I shall have them in about a week. I shall sell a few for 2 f 50 c each, and give the rest away "hoping for nothing in return". </p>
