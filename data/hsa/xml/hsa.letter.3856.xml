            <opener>Verehrter Herr Professor,</opener>
            <p>I have really no patience with you- you dear man! Yes the Hobson-Jobson book<note n="1" place="foot" type="editorial">
                  <bibl>
                     <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.bibliography#BIBL.5682">Yule/Burnell (1886)</ref>
                  </bibl>. Here, he refers to the first edition. The second edition (1903) is more common.</note> is rather expensive but it is large and contains a great deal. And if I were to write out a really full account of all there is in it, or a very small one indeed – you on the other hand in the same time could knock off a few words of creole Slang and a few remarks for my Dicty which would buy the Burnell &amp; Yule<note n="2" place="foot" type="editorial">See footnote 1.</note> twice over. However I <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">would</hi> write or give the <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Auskunft</hi> right willingly if I had the book by me but I have not as I <pb facs="#IMG.2" n="2"/> left it in London with G. May<note n="3" place="foot" type="editorial">Publisher with Ballantyne Press in London, where Leland published his Slang Dictionary (Cf. Briefnummer <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.letter.3853">6371</ref>-<ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.letter.3854">72</ref>).</note> my publisher to whom it belongs. However I can tell you that it is quite a mine of valuable and curious learning as to all Indian familiar subjects and objects, works and things. It is a book which is <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">really</hi> indispensable to you, as you will say when you come to examine it. There is a great number of Oriental words coming into common use, in all European languages, which few, even scholars, fully understand. You could make the Yule Burnell the basis for a <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">capital</hi> book on familiar Oriental terms. There is really <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">too</hi> much in it, and you could <pb facs="#IMG.3" n="3"/> cut down the Hindu and extend the rest to embrace all the Oriental words which are commonly found in German, French and English books. I dare say that any publisher would engage it from you.</p>
            <p>Are you up on <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Jénisch</hi>
               <note n="4" place="foot" type="editorial">“Sondersprache” or sociolect of the Jenisch people in the German speaking territories, historically descends from Rotwelsch (<bibl>

               <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none"/>the common language used on the roads? I had a lesson in it the day before yesterday from a basket maker who was travelling with a van. He knew a great deal of Romany, especially his daughter and this made me at home with them.<hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none"> Jénisch </hi>seems to be the old <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">Rothwälsch</hi> or <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
Kauderwälsch</hi> but more mixed with Gypsy and Hollandish Dieven-taal. Of course there is a great deal of Hebrew in it. They <pb facs="#IMG.4" n="4"/> make a secret of knowing it. In it Romanis becomes Ma’hnis.</p>
            <p>I find an interesting subject of research in the amulets or charms worn by these people especially the gypsies.</p>
            <p>I have great hopes that I shall be in Gratz this Autumn.</p>
            <p>It was a great disappointment, my not getting something from you for the dicty –no matter what- as Maj. Powell<note n="5" place="foot" type="editorial">
