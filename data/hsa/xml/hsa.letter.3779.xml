            <opener>Dear D<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> H. Schuchardt, </opener>
            <p>I have received your assurances that you feel no <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">
groll</hi> towards me, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">and you certainly have no right to feel any towards a would-be friend. </hi>But your behaviour about my brochure offered to, &amp; finally accepted by, your University, and all that you have written to or about me for three years past, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">shews that I cannot count you among my friends</hi>. I <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">regret it very deeply</hi>, and only hope that you may repent <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">&amp; change your mind</hi>. METANOIA! Some Basque students would be glad to know when, &amp; where, &amp; at what price, your edition of Lei√ßarragas new Testament is to appear. I am unable to give any information on the subject, though I was the first to announce your project in a newspaper in Basqueland some years ago. I never received any <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">prospectus</hi> of the edition. Of course I wish to promote its sale, &amp; prepare the road for a good reception for it, even though I expect to find some small reasons for disagreeing with your manner of presenting the text to the public. You told me at Munich that Axular was the only Basque <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">classic</hi>. I think Mendiburus book of 1747 is equal to it, though it does not quote classic authors. My edition of this will be on sale in a few days. A copy on superior paper, post free registered, shall be sent to you, if you let me have <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">here</hi> a post office order, <hi rend="unknown" rendition="#none">payable at Biarritz</hi> to the value of 5 marks.</p>
