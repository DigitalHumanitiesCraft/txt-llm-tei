            <opener>Dear</opener>
            <p>from Oct: 15 till Nov: 15 last I occupied your rooms in M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Goyetches</persName> house at <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Sare</placeName> &amp; learned a good deal of <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref> from <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Augustin Etcheberry</persName> he gained mencion honorifica at Xmas for his verse rendering of my French version of <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Chamberlains</persName> English translation of an ancient Aino fable – you will have seen it entitled Chorien Besta in the number of the <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.subjects#S.5757">
Eskualduna</ref> containing my letter on L’Etude du Basque which I sent you about a month ago. Do you think well of any of my suggestions? Will you kindly tell me where the book you have been writing on Basque borrowed words of which M<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi>. <persName ref="[authorityLink]">
Webster</persName> shewed me a specimen is to be obtained. Your lame professor shewed me with pride the teaservice which you gave him &amp; I have a copy of the inscription - It seems to me that there may be some connection between Gothic haus and <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref> hauzo a voisin since vicinus comes from vicus = Ϝοικος a house - I should very much like to come and join your classes at <placeName ref="[authorityLink]">Gratz</placeName> which I have heard is an enchanting place. The study of languages charms me but I am only an amateur - I think isard must be a contraction of <foreign xml:lang="eu">
ihizi-ardi</foreign> - Have you noticed that the Kentish dialect has hagister = magpie - I cannot help comparing it with <ref target="https://gams.uni-graz.at/o:hsa.languages#L.837">Basque</ref> “<foreign xml:lang="eu">hegasti</foreign>” a big bird - Do you think that Keltic basged which <persName ref="[authorityLink]">Juvenal</persName> calls bascauda may be like the word Basque itself derived from baso and mean that which is made of or from or near the woods? I wish they would write a concordance dictionary in alphabetical order of all known parts of the Basque auxiliary for all dialects.</p>
