Dear Sir and friend,
You may be right indeed, but now, pray consider this: if I were to contest that trembler proceeds from tremulare, you would instantly quote a number of similar processes sufficient to convince me; if I deny that aller can proceed from 
ambulare, you may only appeal to my good faith and common sense. (note 1) That is, I mean, the superiority of the phonetic standard to the semantic: the former affords scientific certainty, the latter mere probability. Now, if you do not understand it as I, I must infer that we have not „le crâne fait de même“ (Musset), (note 2) and I am sorry for it, for yours is a remarkably well made.
Yours truly
V. Henry
