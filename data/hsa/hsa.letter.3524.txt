Dear Dr. Schuchardt, 
verify your references was the advice about reading given towards the end of his live by the most celebrated president of Magdalen College, Oxford, during the present century who in his youth knew Dr. Johnson the lexicologist by sight. Why does it not seem to you à propos for my Concordance? My quotation from the Cornish Dictionary means that I do not wish Basque to become as dead as that Britannic language the sense of the quotations is, 1, a paraphrase of Dr. Rouths advice and, 2, an admonition to fix in the mind what one gleans from the study of Leiçarraga. MrThomas & the Bodleian Librarian tell me that ProfrRhys is the new head of Jesus. I sent about two months ago my collection of Basque inscriptions to padre Fidel Fita who promised to try to have it published in the Boletin de la Real Academia de Historia at Madrid. I have not even heard of its reception but I keep the talon of its posting. I include some words placed by you on a certain teatray that exists in Sara. Will you write to 
Fita at 12 Calle de Isabel la Católica, Madrid, in favour of publishing my collection and that soon? I have not seen the books of Rhys or Stempf mentioned on pages 5 and 13 of 
Websters last pamphlet which is full of careless blunders. You said 24 Dez: 1894 ”Diese spiegelt sich schon in Ihren Briefen ab: da geht Alles wie Kraut und Rüben durcheinander, Etymologien, persönliche Bemerkungen, Textverbesserungen, bibliographische Notizien [sic] usw.[”] In the context I thought you mean I did not know how to make a Bibliography.
