Dear Sir,
I should be very glad to see you here. Madonna di Campiglio is not particularly expensive; but what is expensive that is the journey from Trento to C. Besides, I donâ€™t know if I shall not leave C. in a few days; please to write me your itinerary for the next time, perhaps we can meet somewhere between here and Innsbruck or in the last place.
Yours truly
H.S.
