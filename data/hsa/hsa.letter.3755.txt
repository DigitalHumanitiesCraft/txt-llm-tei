76 Guilford Street, London. W. C. 5 August, 1897. 
Dear Dr H. Schuchardt, 
in a letter of 29 July A Farinelli wrote to me "Schuchardt n’est pas mort mais il souffre terriblement de la neurasthénie qui lui empêche d’écrire à ses amis. Moi-même je ne reçois nulle réponse à mes lettres". If your silence to me wards is due to your illness I regret it very much: but I had begun to look upon the illness as a mere pretext & to believe that jealousy about Basque was the real cause, that you accepted my books etc, but rejected my friendship. It seems that I may have some reason to be jealous too, for Carolina de Michaëlis says in a letter of the same day "De Schuchardt nada sei. Presumo todavia que está de saude: porque recebidélle ha pouco um artigo distinctissimo sobre psychologia linguistica ou linguistica psychologica, provocado pelas Antinomies linguistiques de Victor Henry (Paris 1896)". Now why have you not sent me this book? Did not I write to you some years ago asking you to write on the psychology of Keltic dialects compared with that of Basque? I was at a Welsh church in London last Sunday week & go next week to Wales.
Yours asserretua
E. S. Dodgson.
