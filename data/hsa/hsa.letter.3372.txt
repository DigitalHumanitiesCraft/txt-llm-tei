Dear Profr Schuchardt, 
whoever it is that has poisoned Mr D’Abbadies mind against me, it is certain that he or she has succeeded. He has never thanked me for the 2nd part of my supplement to Vinson, for my copy of the proverbs, for many Basque publications sent to him by me, for my Basque Verb Found and Defined, or for the beginning of my edition of Capanaga, of which the first 40 pages have been definitively printed off, and the type distributed. I felt a filial affection for Mr D’Abbadie, and he has made me several handsome presents - But he is a henpecked husband with a very eccentric wife, who has made much bad blood in Basqueland. I wrote to him in vain, as to many other Bascophiles, for pecuniary and for my Capanaga, of which I have sent you three sets of proofs, which you can keep. Please tell 
Linschmann to write to me. You give no reason for rejecting my thoughts about 
Leilão, and you do not answer my suggestions about Basque and Portuguese 
mamoa. What shall I do with the superfluous beginning of your great work on the verb? I have not yet read all. I am reading Ariostos Lena in an edition of 1620.
